      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file (CBLines.exe) from a hardcoded external URL (https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe) without any user interaction, validation, or consent. It saves this executable in the current working directory and then immediately executes it silently using PowerShell. This pattern of downloading and executing a remote executable without user notification or integrity checks is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution. The use of subprocess to run PowerShell commands to download and run an executable from an external source is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's system. There is no legitimate application logic or user-driven workflow justifying this behavior, and the code lacks error handling or security measures. Therefore, this code is highly suspicious and should be classified as malicious."
