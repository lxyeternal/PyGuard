      "malicious_behavior": "The code sends an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded webhook URL (https://webhook.site/7de0c331-90ee-4e2a-9edc-5e38790807ae/ImBad) without any user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic. The use of a webhook.site URL, which is commonly used for capturing and inspecting HTTP requests, combined with the hardcoded path segment 'ImBad', strongly suggests intent to exfiltrate data or signal to an external party. The code uses subprocess to run a curl command, which is an indirect and less transparent way to perform network communication, often seen in malicious scripts to evade detection. There is no error handling or validation of the data sent or received, and no legitimate context or explanation for this network activity. These factors align with multiple key risk indicators and typical malicious behavior patterns, such as unsolicited network communication to suspicious endpoints and use of hardcoded external URLs for data exfiltration or signaling. Therefore, this code is considered malicious."
