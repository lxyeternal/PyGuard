      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a Python script from a hardcoded external URL ('https://blockatlaspro.com/test.py') without any user interaction, validation, or consent. It writes this script to a hidden directory inside the user's home directory ('AppData\\Local\\App') with a randomized filename, sets the file attribute to hidden, and then immediately executes it in a new subprocess with suppressed stdout and stderr. This pattern matches a classic remote code execution and payload delivery technique commonly used by malware. The use of a suspicious hardcoded URL, writing executable code to a user directory, hiding the file, and executing it without user knowledge or validation are strong indicators of malicious intent. Additionally, the execution is conditional on the presence of a specific file ('src/settings.py'), which may be used to target specific environments or evade detection. There is no legitimate application logic, error handling, or user notification surrounding these actions. Therefore, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware behavior."
