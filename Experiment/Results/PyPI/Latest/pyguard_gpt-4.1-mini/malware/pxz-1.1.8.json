This data exfiltration occurs automatically during the package installation process without any user interaction or consent, embedded in the setup script. The use of a hardcoded IP address as the server endpoint, combined with the automatic execution of network communication during installation, is a classic pattern of malicious behavior often seen in supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this unsolicited data collection and transmission. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious intent."
