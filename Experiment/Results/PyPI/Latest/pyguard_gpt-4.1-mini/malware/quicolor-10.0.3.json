      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains hidden malicious behavior under the guise of a color formatting utility. It silently collects Telegram Desktop user data from the victim's machine by accessing the Telegram data folder in the user's AppData Roaming directory. It compresses this data into a zip file and uploads it to a hardcoded Telegram bot via the Telegram Bot API using a hardcoded bot API key and chat ID. This exfiltration happens without any user consent or interaction, and the code suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. The backup operation runs in a background thread and is ensured to complete before program exit, including via signal handlers and a spawned detached watcher process, indicating an attempt to guarantee data exfiltration even if the program is terminated. The presence of hardcoded Telegram bot credentials, access to sensitive user directories, silent network exfiltration, and background persistence mechanisms are strong indicators of malicious intent. This behavior is unrelated to the stated purpose of the module (color formatting) and constitutes unauthorized data theft and exfiltration."
