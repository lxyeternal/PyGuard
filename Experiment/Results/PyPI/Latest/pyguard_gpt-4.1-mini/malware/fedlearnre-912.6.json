      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system-specific information such as hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information as URL parameters to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that do not correspond to any known legitimate service or application. The domains used (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) are indicative of out-of-band interaction testing or data exfiltration endpoints often used in security testing or malicious activity. There is no legitimate application logic or user-driven context justifying this data collection and transmission. The code silently attempts to reach these URLs and logs the response or errors without notifying the user. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with unsolicited data exfiltration to suspicious external servers is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or reconnaissance malware behavior."
