      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes shell commands during the package installation process without user interaction or consent, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Specifically, in the post-install hook (_post_install), it runs 'pip install pyprettifier' via subprocess.call with shell=True, and then executes a script or module named 'colotama' located in the installation directory. This dynamic execution of shell commands during installation is a high-risk pattern strongly associated with malware. The code does not perform any validation, user notification, or error handling beyond logging exceptions to a temporary file, which further increases suspicion. The use of subprocess.call with shell=True to run arbitrary commands during install is a critical risk indicator for malicious behavior, as it can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's system. Additionally, the package name and author information do not provide any clear legitimate context or justification for these actions. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation."
