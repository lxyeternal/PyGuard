      "malicious_behavior": "The code sends anonymous telemetry data containing environment information (Python version, OS, architecture) and a randomly generated session ID to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/bancor) immediately upon import and again on program exit. This occurs without any user interaction or explicit consent, and the webhook.site domain is a generic external endpoint often used for testing or potentially for data collection by third parties. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which can be used to avoid detection. Although the data sent is not highly sensitive, the unsolicited collection and exfiltration of environment and session data to an external hardcoded URL without user notification or opt-in is a typical characteristic of malicious or at least privacy-invasive behavior. According to the provided knowledge points, the presence of hardcoded external URLs, silent network communication on import and exit, and environment fingerprinting with no user consent are strong indicators of malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior."
