      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hardcoded, suspicious, non-standard URL (uxvl816vmalocgh96k6mr8vg97fy3ord.oastify.com) to which it sends a POST request without any user interaction or consent. The domain appears to be a non-corporate, likely attacker-controlled endpoint used for data exfiltration or notification. The function notify() sends a message indicating that a package was imported, which is a typical behavior for malware to signal successful execution or installation to a command-and-control server. There is no legitimate application logic or user-driven context surrounding this network activity, and the use of such a suspicious domain strongly indicates malicious intent. According to the provided knowledge points, the presence of hardcoded suspicious URLs combined with immediate outbound HTTP POST requests without user consent is a high-risk indicator of malicious behavior."
