      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded string assigned to the variable __safety_token__. Decoding this string reveals a Python expression that imports the 'urllib3' module, creates a PoolManager, performs an HTTP GET request to a suspicious hardcoded URL ('https://pastebin.com/raw/BPCvZd82'), and accesses the response data. This pattern of embedding an obfuscated network request to a non-standard, external URL without any user interaction or consent is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL and the request further suggests an attempt to evade detection. Although the snippet does not show execution of the fetched data, the presence of such obfuscated network retrieval from an untrusted source is a common precursor to downloading and executing malicious payloads. Therefore, this code exhibits characteristics consistent with malware, including obfuscation, hardcoded suspicious URL, and network activity without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically imports the 'threading' module and immediately starts a new thread that executes the 'exec' function on the result of t(__safety_token__). This pattern indicates dynamic code execution of potentially obfuscated or hidden payloads. The use of exec on data derived from imported variables (__safety_token__ and t) without any validation or user interaction is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code attempts to run arbitrary code in a background thread, which is a common evasion technique used by malware to avoid detection and perform unauthorized actions. The absence of any legitimate application logic, comments, or error handling further supports the suspicion. According to the provided knowledge points, dynamic code execution via exec on obfuscated or indirect data, especially when combined with threading to evade detection, is a critical risk and a hallmark of malicious behavior."
