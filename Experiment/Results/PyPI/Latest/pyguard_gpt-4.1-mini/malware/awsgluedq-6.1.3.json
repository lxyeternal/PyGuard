      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/ver) immediately upon import and again during the package installation process via a post-install hook. This behavior triggers network communication without user interaction or consent, embedded in the setup.py installation script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The domain 'pov.sh' is non-standard and unrelated to the package's stated purpose, indicating potential command-and-control or data exfiltration activity. The code overrides the setuptools install command to execute this network request silently during installation, which is a critical risk pattern associated with malware. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity, and the use of a post-install hook to perform external communication is a strong indicator of malicious intent."

The domain 'pov.sh' and the port 45111 are unusual and not associated with standard or trusted services. This pattern of silent network communication to a hardcoded external endpoint is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, potentially for data exfiltration, command-and-control communication, or remote payload retrieval. The absence of any error handling, logging, or user notification further increases suspicion. According to the provided knowledge points, such unsolicited network activity to suspicious URLs without context or user consent is a typical characteristic of malware."
