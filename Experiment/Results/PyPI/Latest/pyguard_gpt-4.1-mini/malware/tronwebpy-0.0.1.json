      "malicious_behavior": "The code sends a private key to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL via an HTTP POST request without any user interaction or consent, which is a strong indicator of credential theft or data exfiltration. The use of a non-standard, hardcoded domain (mockapi.io with a suspicious subdomain) for transmitting sensitive data (private_key) is typical of malicious behavior. Additionally, the code performs a GET request to another endpoint on the same suspicious domain and uses the response to control flow, which may be part of a command-and-control or exfiltration mechanism. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding these network actions, and the function name 'tronwebpy' misleadingly suggests a benign purpose while actually exfiltrating sensitive credentials. These factors align with multiple key risk indicators and typical malicious patterns such as unsolicited collection and transmission of sensitive data to an external server."
