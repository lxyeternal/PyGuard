      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-aws-glue-ml-libs-python) immediately upon import and also during the package installation process via a custom PostInstallCommand subclass of setuptools' install command. This behavior triggers network communication without user interaction or consent during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The domain pov.sh is not a standard or trusted Python package source, and the request is made without any legitimate application logic or user notification. The code embeds this network call directly in the setup script, which is a hallmark of malicious code aiming to execute code or exfiltrate data during installation. There is no validation, error handling, or explanation for these requests, increasing suspicion. This pattern aligns with critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, specifically remote code execution or data exfiltration triggered during package installation, a common malware tactic in Python ecosystems."

The domain 'pov.sh' and the port 45111 are unusual and not associated with any known legitimate service. This pattern of making network requests to hardcoded, suspicious external endpoints is a common indicator of malicious behavior, often used for data exfiltration, command-and-control communication, or remote payload retrieval. There is no legitimate application logic or context surrounding this network activity, increasing suspicion. Based on the provided knowledge points, such behavior is strongly associated with malware and is a critical risk indicator."
