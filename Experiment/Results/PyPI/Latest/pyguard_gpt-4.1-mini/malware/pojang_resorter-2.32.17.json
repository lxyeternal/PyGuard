      "malicious_behavior": "The code captures a screenshot of the user's screen using PIL's ImageGrab and sends the image data via HTTP POST requests to multiple hardcoded Discord webhook URLs. The webhook URLs are suspicious as they are hardcoded and point to Discord's webhook API, which is commonly abused for data exfiltration. The code performs this action without any user interaction or consent, which is a typical characteristic of malicious behavior. Additionally, the code uses obfuscated variable names and indirect calls (e.g., getattr, bytes, and decoding hex strings) to obscure its intent, which is a common evasion technique. The logging is set up to record success or failure of sending the screenshot, but there is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity. The presence of multiple webhook URLs and automated screenshot capture and exfiltration strongly indicates that this code is designed for unauthorized data theft, making it malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable named 'stealer.exe' from a hardcoded, suspicious URL hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/GODOFTHUGS/sounds/raw/main/stealer.exe) without any user interaction or consent. It saves this executable to the same directory as the script, then creates a shortcut to it in the Windows Startup folder to ensure persistence (automatic execution on system startup). Finally, it immediately executes the downloaded executable using subprocess.Popen with shell=True, which runs the file without validation or user notification. This sequence—unsolicited download and execution of a potentially malicious binary, persistence via startup folder modification, and lack of error handling or user consent—is a classic pattern of malware. The executable's name 'stealer.exe' strongly suggests malicious intent (likely credential or data theft). The use of a hardcoded external URL to fetch and run an untrusted executable, combined with persistence mechanisms and immediate execution, matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including remote payload retrieval, persistence setup, and execution of untrusted code. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
