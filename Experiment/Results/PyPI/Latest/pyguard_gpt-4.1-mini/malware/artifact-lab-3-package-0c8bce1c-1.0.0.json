      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools install and develop commands that execute a function (notmalfunc) during package installation or development setup. This function collects all environment variables from the host system (os.environ), encodes them, and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://29c2aa2421c8.ngrok.app). This behavior constitutes unauthorized exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment data without user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded ngrok domain, which is commonly used for tunneling and can be ephemeral or attacker-controlled, further indicates malicious intent. The exfiltration is triggered automatically during package installation or development setup, which is a known supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this data transmission. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware embedded in a Python package installation process."
