      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute additional actions during package installation without user consent. It contains an obfuscated payload represented as a list of integers, which is decoded by subtracting 30 from each integer and converting to characters, reconstructing a Python script. This script is then written to a temporary file (/tmp/xxx.py). Immediately after, the code executes this script by invoking a reverse shell command ('python3 /tmp/xxx.py') via a base64-decoded shell command executed with os.system. This behavior is a classic example of a reverse shell payload embedded in a package installation process, enabling remote code execution and unauthorized remote access to the victim's system. The obfuscation, execution of code during installation, writing and running of temporary files, and use of base64 encoding to hide the shell command are all strong indicators of malicious intent consistent with supply chain attacks and remote access trojans. Therefore, this code is malicious."
