      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes shell commands ('whoami' and 'ip addr') immediately upon package installation without user consent, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. It collects sensitive system information (current user and network interfaces) and silently sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (a Burp Collaborator URL). This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: execution of shell commands during installation, exfiltration of sensitive system information, use of a hardcoded suspicious external URL, silent failure suppression to avoid detection, and embedding malicious payload execution in the setup script. The package name and metadata are crafted to mimic a legitimate package (python-dateutil) to facilitate dependency confusion attacks. All these factors combined confirm that the code contains malicious behavior designed for information theft and supply chain attack vectors."
