      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute a reverse shell payload during package installation. Specifically, it constructs a Python one-liner that creates a TCP socket connecting to a hardcoded IP address (192.168.239.158) and port (1234), duplicates the socket file descriptor to standard input/output/error, disables shell history logging, and spawns an interactive bash shell. This payload is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed via a shell command during the install process. This behavior enables unauthorized remote command execution on the victim's machine without user consent, which is a hallmark of malicious activity, particularly a remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor. The use of code execution triggered automatically during package installation, hardcoded attacker-controlled IP and port, base64 obfuscation, and spawning of an interactive shell are all strong indicators of malicious intent."
