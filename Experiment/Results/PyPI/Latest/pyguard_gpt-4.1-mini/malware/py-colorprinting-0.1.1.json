      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a ZIP file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://cosmoplanets.net/well-known/pki-validation/ore-miner.zip) without any user interaction or consent. It writes the downloaded content directly to a temporary directory, extracts it, and then immediately executes an executable file (ore-miner.exe) from the extracted folder using subprocess.Popen with flags to run the process detached and hidden (DETACHED_PROCESS and CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP). There is no validation, integrity check, or user notification regarding the downloaded file or the execution of the binary. The domain and file names are generic and suspicious, and the behavior matches a classic download-and-execute malware pattern, often used for remote payload retrieval and local persistence. The code suppresses exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. These factors strongly indicate malicious intent."
