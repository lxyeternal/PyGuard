      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system-specific information including the hostname and local IP address, then fetches the public IP address via an external HTTP GET request. It immediately sends this collected data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external webhook URL on slack.com, which is a non-standard and suspicious endpoint for such data exfiltration. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this network activity. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL for sending system information without transparency or user consent is a strong indicator of data exfiltration behavior. According to the provided knowledge points, this pattern—collecting environment data and immediately exfiltrating it to a hardcoded external endpoint without user interaction—is strongly associated with malicious activity."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system-specific information including the hostname and local IP address, as well as the public IP address of the machine by querying an external service (https://api.ipify.org). It then immediately sends this information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external webhook URL on Slack (https://hooks.slack.com/services/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) without any user interaction, consent, or notification. This behavior matches multiple high-risk and critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including unsolicited collection and exfiltration of system fingerprinting data to a hardcoded external endpoint, use of a hardcoded webhook URL for data exfiltration, absence of legitimate application logic or user consent, and immediate outbound network communication with sensitive environment data. Such patterns are strongly associated with information-stealing malware or reconnaissance components of malware, making this code malicious."
