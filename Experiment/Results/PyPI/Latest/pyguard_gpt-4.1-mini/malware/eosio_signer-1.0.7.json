      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It executes shell commands during package setup without user interaction, collecting sensitive system information such as hostname, current user, and network configuration, and writes this data along with environment variables (which likely contain sensitive keys) to a temporary file. Immediately after, it exfiltrates this collected data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external IP address (http://61.28.229.27). This sequence of environment variable access, file writing, shell command execution, and network exfiltration during package installation is a classic pattern of information-stealing malware and supply chain attack. The use of os.system to run commands like 'hostname', 'whoami', and 'ifconfig' and the absence of any legitimate application logic or user consent further confirm the malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. Specifically, in the EOSIOKey class constructor (__init__), it imports subprocess and requests modules and immediately executes the following commands without any user interaction or consent: it runs 'hostname', 'whoami', and 'ifconfig' commands on the local system, redirecting their outputs to a temporary file '/tmp/r'. Then, it opens this file and sends its contents via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external IP address 'http://61.28.229.27'. This sequence is a classic example of environment discovery and data exfiltration to a suspicious, hardcoded external server. There is no legitimate application logic or user consent surrounding this network activity, and the use of subprocess.getoutput to gather system information combined with immediate exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The rest of the code appears to implement cryptographic key handling for EOSIO keys, which is benign, but the embedded data collection and exfiltration in the constructor is a critical risk and hallmark of malware."
