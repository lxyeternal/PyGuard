      "malicious_behavior": "The code sends a private key to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL via an HTTP POST request without any user interaction or consent, which is a strong indicator of data exfiltration. The URL 'https://66c0dc0bba6f27ca9a57c4bf.mockapi.io/tron' appears to be a non-standard, potentially attacker-controlled endpoint. The function collects sensitive information (private_key) and transmits it externally, which aligns with typical malicious behavior patterns such as credential theft or information exfiltration. Additionally, the code performs a GET request to another suspicious endpoint and uses its response to control flow, which may be part of a command-and-control mechanism. There is no legitimate application logic or user consent evident, and the use of hardcoded external URLs for sending sensitive data is a critical red flag for malicious intent."
