      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that executes during the package installation process (setup.py install hook). It collects detailed system information including hostname, current working directory, username, platform details, CPU and RAM info, Python version, and site-packages path. It also fetches data from an unrelated external API (PokeAPI for Charizard) seemingly to mask or pad the payload. Then, it exfiltrates all this collected system information to two hardcoded external endpoints: a Webhook.site URL and a Burp Collaborator (Oastify) URL. This exfiltration happens automatically during installation without any user interaction or consent. The use of hardcoded, suspicious external URLs for data exfiltration, combined with the automatic execution of network requests during package installation, is a classic supply chain attack pattern. The code performs environment discovery and immediate data exfiltration, which are strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this behavior, no error handling, and no user notification. According to the provided knowledge points, this pattern is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks, making this code malicious."
