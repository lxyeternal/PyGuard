      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the setuptools install command to execute additional code during package installation without user consent. It runs a shell command ('ls') to list directory contents, collects sensitive environment information including hostname, current working directory, and username, and then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external IP address (http://192.198.82.14:3000/log). This behavior is a classic example of environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration embedded in a package installation script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded IP address for data exfiltration, lack of user interaction or notification, execution of shell commands during install, and immediate outbound network communication to an untrusted endpoint are all strong indicators of malicious intent according to the provided knowledge points."
