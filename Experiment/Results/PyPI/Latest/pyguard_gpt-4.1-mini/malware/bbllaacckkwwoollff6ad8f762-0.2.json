      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior: 1) It subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to run code during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. 2) It fetches and executes remote code via an HTTP GET request from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://blackwolf.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/rw/b) without any user interaction or validation, using exec() on the downloaded content, enabling arbitrary remote code execution. 3) It conditionally triggers this behavior only if the current username is 'modelarts', indicating targeted or stealthy execution. 4) It includes commented-out code for collecting system command output, encoding it in base64, and sending it via HTTP PUT to the same suspicious domain, suggesting potential data exfiltration capabilities. 5) The use of hardcoded external endpoints unrelated to any known legitimate package or service, combined with dynamic code execution during installation, is a hallmark of malicious supply chain attacks. 6) There is no legitimate application logic or user consent surrounding the network activity or code execution. These factors collectively confirm that the code is malicious."
