      "malicious_behavior": "The code subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command with a custom class CrazyInstallStrat. In the run() method, after running the standard install process, it dynamically imports a main() function from a module named 'main' and immediately executes it during package installation. This pattern of executing arbitrary code at install time without user interaction or consent is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The dynamic import and execution of main() during installation can be used to run arbitrary or harmful code on the victim's system. Although the code snippet itself does not show network activity or obfuscation, the execution of code during installation without explicit user consent is a critical risk indicator of malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution and potential further malicious payload delivery. Therefore, this code is considered malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system-specific information such as hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent and sends this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that do not correspond to any known legitimate service. The URLs have unusual domain names with patterns typical of out-of-band interaction services often used for exfiltration or command-and-control. The code performs this network communication silently without user interaction or notification, which is a common trait of malware performing system fingerprinting and data exfiltration. Although the code does not execute downloaded content or spawn shells, the unsolicited collection and transmission of sensitive environment data to suspicious external endpoints strongly indicates malicious intent."
