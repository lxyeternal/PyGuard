      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to run custom code during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The exec_command function executes the shell command 'id' to gather system user identity information, encodes the output in base64 (with padding removed), and sends it via an HTTP PUT request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (blackwolf.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com) without any user interaction or consent. This pattern of collecting system information and exfiltrating it to a remote server during package installation is a classic hallmark of malware. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the data being sent further supports malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification justifying this behavior. Therefore, this code is malicious and likely part of a supply chain attack or information-stealing malware."
