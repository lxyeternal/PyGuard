      "malicious_behavior": "The function confirm_transaction collects the wallet's private key in hex format (wallet.secret().hex()) and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Telegram bot API endpoint and chat ID. This behavior constitutes exfiltration of sensitive credentials (private key) without user consent or notification. The hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID indicate a fixed external recipient controlled by an attacker. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this network communication. The code silently sends sensitive wallet secrets to an external server, which is a classic pattern of credential theft and data exfiltration, a highly malicious behavior."
