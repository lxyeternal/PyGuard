      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools commands that execute a shell command during package installation, development setup, and egg info generation. This shell command fetches an access token from the Google Cloud metadata service (http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token) without user consent, then immediately sends this token via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (https://9435-34-42-190-190.ngrok-free.app/hellofrompip). This behavior is a classic example of data exfiltration embedded in the package installation process, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded ngrok domain for exfiltration, absence of user interaction or notification, execution of shell commands during install hooks, and transmission of sensitive credentials to an untrusted external endpoint are all strong indicators of malicious intent. Therefore, this code is malicious."
