      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method. In this overridden run method, after running the standard install process, it dynamically imports a main() function from a module named 'main' and immediately executes it during package installation. This pattern of executing arbitrary code at install time without user interaction or consent is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The dynamic import and execution of code during installation can be used to run arbitrary payloads, potentially leading to system compromise. Although the code snippet itself does not show network activity or obfuscation, the immediate execution of code from an external module during installation is a critical risk indicator of malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's system during package installation. This behavior aligns with the known malicious pattern of abusing the installation process for code execution, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, then encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends all this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs. These URLs are non-standard, seemingly random subdomains under unusual domains (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun), which are commonly used for out-of-band interaction testing or malicious data exfiltration. The code performs this data collection and exfiltration without any user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic. The use of base64 encoding for the MAC addresses before transmission is a known obfuscation technique to evade detection. The silent exception handling suppresses any errors, further indicating an attempt to avoid detection. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with covert data exfiltration to suspicious external endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or staging malware behavior."
