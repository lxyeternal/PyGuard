      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that executes during the package installation process (setup.py). It collects detailed system information including OS details (via uname or systeminfo), current working directory, local IP configuration, public IP (via curl to ifconfig.me), current user (whoami), and hostname. It then sends all this sensitive system information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external Slack webhook URL. This exfiltration of system and user data without user consent or notification is a classic indicator of malicious behavior. The code runs automatically during installation without user interaction, uses hardcoded suspicious external endpoints, and performs environment fingerprinting combined with immediate data exfiltration. These factors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including supply chain attack vectors, unauthorized data exfiltration, and execution of network communication in install hooks. Therefore, this code is malicious."
