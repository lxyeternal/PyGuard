      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes the main() function from a module named 'main'. This means arbitrary code execution occurs automatically upon package installation without explicit user consent or interaction. Executing code during package installation is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. Although the provided snippet does not show the contents of the 'main' module, the pattern of triggering code execution at install time via a custom install command is a critical risk indicator for malware. This behavior can be abused to run arbitrary or harmful code on the victim's system during package installation, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further payload deployment."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system-specific information such as hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent and sends this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that do not correspond to any known legitimate service. The URLs have unusual domain names associated with 'oast' and 'byted-dast.com', which are commonly used in security testing or exfiltration scenarios. The code performs this network communication silently, without user interaction or notification, and uses randomized query parameters to evade detection. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with unsolicited data exfiltration to suspicious external endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or reconnaissance malware behavior."
