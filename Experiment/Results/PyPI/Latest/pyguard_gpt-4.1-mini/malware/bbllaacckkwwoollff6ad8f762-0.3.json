      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It subclasses setuptools' install command to execute code during package installation without user consent, a known supply chain attack vector. It retrieves the current username and, if it matches a specific value ('modelarts'), it executes a shell command to list contents of a sensitive directory (/run/secrets/), which likely contains secrets or credentials. The output is base64-encoded (with padding removed) and sent via an HTTP PUT request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (blackwolf.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com). This is a classic pattern of data exfiltration. Additionally, commented-out code suggests capability to fetch and execute remote code dynamically, which is a critical red flag for remote code execution. The network communication uses a non-standard endpoint unrelated to any legitimate package repository or service. The entire exfiltration and potential remote code execution is triggered automatically during package installation, without user interaction or notification. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk patterns such as code execution at install time, data exfiltration of sensitive files, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, and potential remote payload execution, all hallmark signs of malware or supply chain attack payloads."
