      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method to execute arbitrary code during installation without user consent. The run() method checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload. This decrypted payload is then executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution. The payload is obfuscated and hidden inside the install hook, a common supply chain attack vector. The use of encrypted payload and exec() during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows the attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine at install time. The package metadata and class names are obfuscated and meaningless, further indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only for this malicious payload execution. The code does not perform any legitimate application logic around this network or execution activity. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution during package installation, obfuscated encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code without user interaction or notification."
