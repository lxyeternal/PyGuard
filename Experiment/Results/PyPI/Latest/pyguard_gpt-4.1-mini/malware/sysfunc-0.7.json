      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated and generated by Pyarmor, a tool commonly used to protect Python scripts by encrypting and obfuscating the code. The code imports a runtime module and calls a function __pyarmor__ with a large encrypted byte string. This pattern is a strong indicator of obfuscated code that dynamically decrypts and executes payloads at runtime. Such behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators: use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and encrypted payloads to evade static analysis. The absence of any readable logic or comments, combined with the encrypted payload, suggests the code is designed to hide its true intent, which is a hallmark of malicious code. Without the decryption key or runtime environment, the exact behavior cannot be determined, but based on the known patterns and the extensive obfuscation, this code is highly likely to contain malicious behavior."
