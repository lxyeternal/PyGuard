      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file (Anch.exe) from a hardcoded external URL (https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/Anch.exe) without any user interaction, validation, or consent. It saves this executable in the current working directory and then immediately executes it silently using PowerShell's Start-Process with -NoNewWindow and -Wait flags. This pattern of downloading and executing a remote executable without user notification or integrity checks is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution. The use of a hardcoded URL to fetch an executable and the immediate execution of that file strongly indicates malicious intent, as it enables remote code execution and potential system compromise. There is no legitimate application logic, error handling, or user consent involved, which further supports the classification of this code as malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file (Anch.exe) from a hardcoded external URL (https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/Anch.exe) without any user interaction or consent, saves it directly to the current working directory, and then executes it silently using PowerShell. This pattern of downloading and executing a remote executable without validation or user notification is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution. The use of subprocess to run PowerShell commands for downloading and executing the file, combined with the absence of any integrity checks, user prompts, or legitimate application logic, strongly indicates malicious intent. The hardcoded URL points to a non-standard location for executable payloads, increasing suspicion. Overall, this code exhibits critical risk behaviors consistent with remote payload retrieval and execution, which are foundational steps in many malware infection chains."
