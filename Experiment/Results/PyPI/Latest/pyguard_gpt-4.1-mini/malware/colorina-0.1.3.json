      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive user information and credentials without user consent and exfiltrates them to a hardcoded external Discord webhook URL. Specifically, it gathers system information (username, computer name, hardware UUID, public IP), extracts Discord tokens from local storage files, retrieves saved browser passwords from Chrome's SQLite database (though encrypted), and reads Minecraft account credentials from local JSON files. All this data is sent via HTTP POST requests to a Discord webhook, which is a known method for covert data exfiltration. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL, combined with the automated collection of sensitive tokens and credentials, and the lack of any user interaction or notification, strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as unsolicited data collection, exfiltration to a suspicious external endpoint, and targeting of sensitive user data."
