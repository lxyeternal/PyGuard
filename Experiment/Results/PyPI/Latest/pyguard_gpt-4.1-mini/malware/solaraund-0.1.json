      "malicious_behavior": "The code overrides the setuptools install command to perform unauthorized actions during package installation without user consent. Specifically, it downloads an executable file (CBLines.exe) from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe) directly to the current working directory. After downloading, it immediately executes this file using PowerShell's Start-Process. This pattern of downloading and executing an external executable during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. There is no validation, user notification, or consent before these actions, and the executable is fetched from a non-standard, suspicious source. The use of subprocess with shell=True to run PowerShell commands further increases risk. These behaviors match multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including arbitrary code execution at install time, downloading and running untrusted code, and abuse of the installation process for code execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."
