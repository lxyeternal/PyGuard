      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to run code during package installation without user consent, a known supply chain attack vector. The exec_command function collects system information by running 'id' and enumerating the '/etc/' directory tree, then encodes this data in base64 and sends it via an HTTP PUT request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (blackwolf.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com) with a randomized URL path. This pattern of environment discovery, data encoding, and exfiltration to a non-standard external endpoint is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware. The network communication is done silently during installation, with no user interaction or notification. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the payload further supports malicious intent. The code also attempts to get the current username and only proceeds if the user is not 'root', possibly to avoid detection or sandbox environments. Overall, the combination of executing code at install time, collecting sensitive system information, encoding it, and exfiltrating it to a suspicious external server without user consent or legitimate purpose classifies this code as malicious."
