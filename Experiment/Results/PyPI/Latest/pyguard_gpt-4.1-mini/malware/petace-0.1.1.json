      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects the hostname of the machine and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external URL that is base64-encoded and decoded at runtime to avoid easy detection. The URL domain (decoded from base64) appears suspicious and is not a standard or well-known domain associated with legitimate applications. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to evade detection. The code sends system-specific information (hostname) to an external server without any user interaction or consent, which is a hallmark of information-stealing or staging malware. Additionally, the SSL context disables certificate verification, which can facilitate man-in-the-middle attacks or communication with malicious servers. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity, increasing suspicion. Based on the provided knowledge points, this pattern of environment discovery combined with obfuscated data transmission to a suspicious external endpoint is strongly associated with malicious behavior."
