      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and executes the main() function from a module named 'main' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time, which is a well-known supply chain attack vector. The package name 'sphinx_rdt_theme' appears generic and may be used to disguise malicious intent. The install_requires includes 'requests' and 'psutil', which are common libraries used in malware for network communication and system process manipulation, although their presence alone is not conclusive. The key risk indicator is the execution of code during package installation without user awareness or explicit consent, which is strongly associated with malicious activity. Since the actual 'main' module and its main() function are not shown, the code snippet itself acts as a loader or trigger for potentially malicious payloads. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding before exfiltration is a known obfuscation technique to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard, suspicious, and likely attacker-controlled. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with covert data exfiltration to hardcoded suspicious endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or staging malware. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior."
