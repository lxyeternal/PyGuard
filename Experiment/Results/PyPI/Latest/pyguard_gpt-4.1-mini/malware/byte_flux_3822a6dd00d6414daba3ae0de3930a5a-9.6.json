      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and executes a main() function from a module named 'main' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time, which is a well-known supply chain attack vector. The package name and author information are generic and anonymous, which is suspicious. The install_requires includes 'requests' and 'psutil', common libraries used in malware for network communication and system information gathering, although their usage is not shown here. The key malicious indicator is the execution of code during package installation (via the overridden install command), which can lead to remote code execution, system compromise, or further payload delivery without user awareness. This pattern is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks in Python ecosystems."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names that do not correspond to any known legitimate services. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before exfiltration is a common tactic in malware to evade detection. The domains used for data exfiltration are non-standard and appear to be attacker-controlled. The code silently suppresses all exceptions during network communication, which is typical for malware to avoid detection. The overall behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including environment fingerprinting, data encoding, and exfiltration to suspicious external endpoints without user consent or notification."
