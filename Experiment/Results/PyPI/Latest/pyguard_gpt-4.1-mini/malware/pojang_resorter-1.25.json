      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command that, immediately after package installation, runs an executable file ('your_executable.exe') located inside the installed package directory without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack vector, where arbitrary code execution is triggered during package installation. The execution of an .exe file post-installation without validation, user notification, or error handling is highly suspicious and consistent with malicious patterns used to deploy payloads or malware silently. Such post-install hooks that execute binaries are strongly associated with malware, as they enable attackers to run arbitrary code on the victim's system during a trusted installation process."
