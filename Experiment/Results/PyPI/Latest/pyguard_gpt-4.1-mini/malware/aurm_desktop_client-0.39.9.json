      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class PreferredSettings that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, it silently downloads a Python script from a hardcoded external URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) without any user interaction or validation. It writes this downloaded content to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py). Then, it attempts to append a command to execute this script automatically in the user's shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile), effectively establishing persistence by running the downloaded script on every new shell session. The code suppresses all exceptions, avoiding detection or error reporting. This pattern of downloading and writing executable code from an external source during package installation, combined with modifying user shell configuration files to execute that code persistently, is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user consent involved, and the behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution at install time, persistence setup, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, and silent failure handling."
