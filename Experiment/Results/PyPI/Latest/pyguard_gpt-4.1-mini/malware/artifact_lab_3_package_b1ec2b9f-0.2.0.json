      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects all environment variables from the host system, encodes them in base64, and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://upnasfwuhrawecezwlst8birymund77bc.oast.fun) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators of malicious activity, including environment discovery, data encoding to evade detection, and exfiltration of potentially sensitive system information to an attacker-controlled server. The use of a non-standard, suspicious domain and the absence of legitimate application logic or user notification further confirm that this code is designed for unauthorized data exfiltration, a hallmark of malware."
