      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class PreferredSettings that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) without any user interaction or consent. The response content is written directly to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py). Then, it attempts to append a command to execute this downloaded Python script (\"python3 ~/.fleetwood.py\") to the user's shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) if not already present. This behavior effectively sets up persistence by ensuring the downloaded script runs automatically on new shell sessions. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is a common evasion technique. There is no validation, integrity check, or user notification regarding the downloaded content. Executing code fetched from an external source during package installation without user consent is a classic supply chain attack vector and a critical security risk. The use of a hidden file in the home directory and modification of shell startup files to run remote code indicates malicious intent aimed at remote code execution and persistence. Therefore, this code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior."
