      "malicious_behavior": "The code subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command, which is a known vector for executing code during package installation without user consent. In the overridden run method, it collects system information including hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://o2zel35m.requestrepo.com). This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: execution of network communication during package installation, exfiltration of system-specific data (hostname, cwd, username) to a non-standard, suspicious URL, and lack of any legitimate application logic or user interaction. The use of a hardcoded, non-corporate domain for data exfiltration during install time is a strong hallmark of malicious activity, consistent with supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware. There is no error handling, user notification, or legitimate purpose evident in the code. Therefore, this code is malicious."
