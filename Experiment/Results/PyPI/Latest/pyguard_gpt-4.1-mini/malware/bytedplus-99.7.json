      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method. In this method, after running the standard install process, it dynamically imports a main() function from a module named 'main' and immediately executes it during package installation. This pattern of executing arbitrary code at install time without user interaction or consent is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The dynamic import and execution of main() during installation can be used to run arbitrary, potentially harmful code on the user's system. Although the code snippet itself does not show the contents of the 'main' module, the installation hook's behavior is suspicious and matches critical risk patterns for malware delivery and execution during package installation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system-specific information such as hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent and sends this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that do not correspond to any known legitimate service. The domains used (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) are indicative of out-of-band interaction testing or data exfiltration endpoints commonly used in malicious activities. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this network communication. The code silently attempts to reach these URLs and logs responses or errors without notifying the user. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with unsolicited data exfiltration to suspicious external servers is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or reconnaissance malware behavior."
