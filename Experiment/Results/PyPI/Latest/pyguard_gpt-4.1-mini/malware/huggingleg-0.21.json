      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command during the package setup process without user interaction or consent. Specifically, it checks an environment variable 'X' and if not set to 'True', it runs a bash command that downloads a file named 'pytorch' from a hardcoded suspicious IP address (122.51.221.63), makes it executable, and runs it in the background using nohup. This pattern is a classic indicator of malicious behavior: it downloads and executes a potentially untrusted binary from an external IP during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded IP address instead of a domain, lack of validation or user notification, and execution of the downloaded file without any integrity checks or transparency strongly indicate malicious intent."

This pattern is a classic indicator of malicious behavior: it fetches and executes potentially untrusted code from an external source without any user interaction, validation, or consent. The use of a raw IP address instead of a legitimate domain, the direct execution of the downloaded file, and the lack of error handling or logging further increase the risk. This behavior aligns with known malware tactics for remote payload retrieval and execution, which can lead to system compromise, persistence, or further malicious activity."
