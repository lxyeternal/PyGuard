      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class 'PreferredSettings' that overrides the standard setuptools install process. During installation, it silently downloads a Python script from a hardcoded, external URL ('https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb') without any user interaction or consent. It writes this downloaded content directly to a hidden file in the user's home directory ('~/.fleetwood.py'). Then, it attempts to append a command to execute this script ('python3 ~/.fleetwood.py') into common shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) if not already present, ensuring the script runs automatically on new shell sessions. This behavior effectively establishes persistence by executing potentially untrusted, remote code on the user's system without validation, notification, or explicit permission. The silent exception handling suppresses any errors, further hiding its activity. Executing code fetched from an external source during package installation, combined with modifying user shell profiles to run that code persistently, is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent."
