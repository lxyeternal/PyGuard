      "malicious_behavior": "The code searches for folders named 'Telegram Desktop' on multiple drives and looks for the presence of 'Telegram.exe' to confirm the target. It then copies files from these folders, excluding certain directories and files, into a temporary directory. After that, it compresses the copied files into a ZIP archive. The archive is then uploaded via HTTP POST to a hardcoded external IP address (http://77.91.76.45:100/OPEN) without any user interaction or consent. The code also queries the same URL via HTTP GET to determine a directory number for the upload path, indicating some form of remote coordination or data organization. The use of a hardcoded suspicious IP address, silent exception handling, no user notification, and exfiltration of potentially sensitive user data (Telegram Desktop files) to an external server are strong indicators of malicious behavior. This pattern matches typical data exfiltration malware that targets user data and sends it to attacker-controlled infrastructure. Therefore, the code is malicious."
