      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class (CrazyInstallStrat) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and executes a function main() from a module named main without any user interaction or consent. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time, which is a well-known supply chain attack vector. The package name 'huggingfaces_hub' and version '95.6' appear to mimic a legitimate package, which is a common tactic for typosquatting or masquerading. The dynamic import and execution of main() during installation is suspicious because it can run any code on the user's system without explicit permission or validation. This pattern is strongly associated with malicious activity, as it enables attackers to execute arbitrary payloads during package installation, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. There is no indication of legitimate application logic justifying this behavior, no user prompts, no error handling, and no transparency. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic surrounding this network activity. The use of base64 encoding before transmission is a common obfuscation tactic to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard, suspicious, and likely attacker-controlled, indicating data exfiltration. The code silently suppresses exceptions, further indicating an attempt to avoid detection. Collecting and exfiltrating system fingerprinting data to hardcoded suspicious endpoints without user consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, often associated with information-stealing malware or reconnaissance stages of an attack. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
