      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and executes the main() function from a module named 'main'. This means arbitrary code execution occurs immediately upon package installation without user interaction or consent. This pattern is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The package name 'typing_extension' and version '95.6' appear suspicious and may be an attempt at typosquatting or masquerading as a legitimate package. The install_requires includes 'requests' and 'psutil', which are common libraries used in malware for network communication and system information gathering. The dynamic import and execution of code during install time, especially from a module not included or verified, is a critical risk indicator of malware. There is no indication of legitimate application logic or user notification around this behavior. Therefore, this code exhibits a classic malicious pattern of executing arbitrary code during package installation, consistent with supply chain attacks."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding for the MAC addresses before exfiltration is a known obfuscation technique to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard, suspicious, and likely attacker-controlled, indicating command-and-control or data exfiltration endpoints. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The overall behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including environment fingerprinting, data encoding, and exfiltration to hardcoded suspicious endpoints without user consent or legitimate purpose."
