      "malicious_behavior": "The code sends a private key to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL via an HTTP POST request without any user interaction or consent, which is a strong indicator of data exfiltration. The use of a non-standard, hardcoded domain (mockapi.io subdomain) for transmitting sensitive information like a private key is suspicious and aligns with typical malicious behavior patterns involving credential theft or information stealing. Additionally, the code performs a GET request to another endpoint on the same suspicious domain and uses the response to control flow, which may be part of a command-and-control or remote control mechanism. There is no legitimate application logic or user consent surrounding these network activities, and the function name and variable names do not clarify any benign purpose. These factors collectively indicate that the code is designed to stealthily exfiltrate sensitive data to an attacker-controlled server, classifying it as malicious."
