      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, IP address, and username without user consent and immediately sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, attacker-controlled URL, which is a classic data exfiltration pattern. Additionally, the code includes a commented-out reverse shell payload that, if enabled, would spawn an interactive bash shell connected to an attacker-specified IP and port, enabling remote command execution and full control over the victim system. The use of hardcoded external URLs and IP addresses, absence of user interaction or legitimate application logic, and immediate outbound network communication with sensitive data are strong indicators of malicious intent. The reverse shell payload is a well-known hallmark of malware, specifically remote access trojans (RATs) or backdoors. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
