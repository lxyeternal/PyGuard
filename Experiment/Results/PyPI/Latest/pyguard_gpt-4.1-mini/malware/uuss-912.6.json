      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method. During the installation process, it calls the original install.run(self) and then dynamically imports and executes main() from a module named main. This means arbitrary code execution occurs immediately upon package installation without explicit user consent or interaction. Executing code during package installation is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The code does not provide any indication that the main() function is benign or related to legitimate setup logic, and the use of dynamic import and execution in the install hook is suspicious. This pattern matches the critical risk indicator of arbitrary code execution triggered during package installation, which is a hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent and sends this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs. The domains used (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) are non-standard and appear to be related to out-of-band interaction testing or potentially attacker-controlled endpoints. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this data collection and transmission. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with unsolicited data exfiltration to hardcoded suspicious domains is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or reconnaissance malware behavior."
