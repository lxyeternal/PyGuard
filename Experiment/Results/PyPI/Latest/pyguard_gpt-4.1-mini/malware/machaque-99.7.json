      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and executes the main() function from a module named 'main' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time, which is a well-known supply chain attack vector. Executing code during package installation without explicit user approval is a critical risk and strongly associated with malware. Although the code itself does not show obfuscation or network activity, the pattern of running arbitrary code on install is a hallmark of malicious packages aiming to execute payloads or further compromise the system during installation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious, and non-standard external URLs with domains that appear unrelated to any legitimate application or service. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with unsolicited data exfiltration to external endpoints is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, often associated with information-stealing malware or reconnaissance stages of an attack. The absence of legitimate application logic, user notification, or validation, along with the use of randomized query parameters to evade detection, further supports the conclusion that this code is designed for covert data exfiltration and is therefore malicious."
