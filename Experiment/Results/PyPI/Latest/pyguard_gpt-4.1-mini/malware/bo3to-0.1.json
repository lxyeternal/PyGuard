      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class 'gpl' that overrides the standard setuptools install process. During installation, it performs an obfuscated operation: it decodes a ROT13-like encoded string into a payload 'h'. It then reads the '/etc/passwd' file line by line, parsing each line to find entries where the third colon-separated field equals '1000' (commonly a user ID). For each such user, it attempts to open and append the decoded payload 'h' to the user's '.profile' file in their home directory. This behavior effectively injects hidden code into user profile scripts without user consent or notification, which will execute when the user logs in or starts a shell session. The obfuscation, silent exception suppression, execution triggered during package installation, and unauthorized modification of user environment files are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern aligns with known supply chain attack vectors where malicious code is embedded in package installation scripts to achieve persistence and execute arbitrary code on victim systems."
