      "malicious_behavior": "The code subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command in setup.py, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. During installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username without user consent. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (odslepmanwwqhnzahpzfop2kwz8m2bxoo.oast.fun), which is not related to any legitimate package repository or service. This behavior is consistent with environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration commonly seen in malicious packages. The network communication is performed silently during package installation, without user interaction or notification, which is a critical risk pattern for malware. The use of a hardcoded, non-standard URL for data exfiltration combined with execution during install time strongly indicates malicious intent and potential for supply chain compromise."
