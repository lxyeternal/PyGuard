      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of executing arbitrary, obfuscated code at install time without user consent or interaction, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious packages. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows attackers to hide the true payload and execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. Additionally, the package setup includes suspicious metadata (random strings for description and author), and the install hook triggers code execution only on Windows, which is typical for targeted attacks. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as arbitrary code execution during install, obfuscated payloads, use of cryptography to hide payload, and execution without user consent."
