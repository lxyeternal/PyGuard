      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a network socket and connects to a hardcoded external IP address (3.36.68.86) on port 16000 without any user interaction or consent. It then enters an infinite loop where it receives commands from the remote server, executes them on the local system using subprocess.getoutput (which runs shell commands), and sends back the output to the remote server. This behavior is a classic reverse shell or remote access trojan (RAT) pattern, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary commands remotely on the victim machine. There is no legitimate application logic, no error handling, no user notification, and the use of hardcoded IP and port for outbound connection is suspicious. This pattern is a well-known hallmark of malicious code used for unauthorized remote control, data exfiltration, or system compromise."
