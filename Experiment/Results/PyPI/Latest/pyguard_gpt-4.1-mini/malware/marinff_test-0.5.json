      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute a reverse shell payload during package installation. Specifically, it constructs a Python one-liner reverse shell command that attempts to connect back to a hardcoded IP address (192.168.239.158) on port 1234. This command duplicates the socket file descriptor to stdin, stdout, and stderr, spawns a bash shell, and suppresses shell history logging. The reverse shell command is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed via a shell command using os.system. This behavior enables an attacker to gain remote command execution on the victim's machine immediately upon installing the package, without user consent or interaction. Such execution of arbitrary code during package installation, especially a reverse shell to a hardcoded IP, is a classic and critical indicator of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks and remote access trojans. Therefore, this code is malicious."
