      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. Specifically, it collects environment information such as the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://468dsoou932zmzkp79cjaogzzq5ht9hy.oastify.com). This behavior occurs automatically during the installation process without any user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of a non-standard, hardcoded domain unrelated to the package's stated purpose, combined with environment fingerprinting and immediate data exfiltration during install, matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including: - Execution of network communication during package installation (exec_setuptools_install + send_http_get) - Collection and exfiltration of system-specific data (hostname, cwd, username) - Use of a suspicious, hardcoded external URL for data transmission - Absence of legitimate application logic or user notification around this network activity These factors strongly indicate that the code is designed to stealthily collect and exfiltrate sensitive environment information as part of a malicious supply chain attack or information-stealing malware. Therefore, the code is malicious."
