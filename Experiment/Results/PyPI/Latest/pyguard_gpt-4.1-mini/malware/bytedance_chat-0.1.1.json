      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects the hostname of the machine and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, base64-obfuscated external URL (https://6fdfcce6.0wn.sh). The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL indicates an attempt to evade casual inspection. The code disables SSL certificate verification (ssl._create_unverified_context), which is often used to bypass security checks and communicate with potentially malicious servers. There is no user interaction or consent before sending potentially sensitive system information (hostname) to an external, suspicious domain. The domain '0wn.sh' is not a standard or trusted domain and is commonly associated with hacking or malicious activity. The code prints the response content from the external server, which could be used to receive commands or payloads. Although the code does not directly execute the received content, the pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with data exfiltration to a suspicious, obfuscated external endpoint is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with known malware behaviors such as system reconnaissance and potential command-and-control communication."
