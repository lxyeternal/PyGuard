      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, platform details, local IP addresses, and domain names associated with the host. It then immediately sends this collected data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/gsa) without any user interaction, consent, or notification. This behavior matches a classic pattern of system fingerprinting and data exfiltration commonly observed in malware. The use of a hardcoded webhook.site URL, which is a service often used for testing or as a placeholder but can be abused for data collection, further raises suspicion. There is no legitimate application logic or user-driven context justifying this unsolicited data collection and transmission. The code suppresses exceptions silently, avoiding detection or error reporting. Although the code does not perform direct code execution or file writing, the immediate outbound transmission of sensitive system information to an external endpoint without user consent is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or reconnaissance malware."
