      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is obfuscated and appears to be a base64-encoded string representing Python code. Decoding the visible fragments reveals that it dynamically constructs a Python executable path, uses subprocess to execute shell commands, and conditionally runs Python scripts or executables. The code checks for the existence of certain paths and executes shell commands accordingly. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), dynamic execution, and shell command invocation without user interaction or validation strongly indicates malicious intent. Such patterns are typical in malware that downloads or executes payloads stealthily, evades detection, and potentially performs unauthorized actions on the host system. The absence of legitimate application logic, combined with obfuscation and shell execution, aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior."

After decoding, it reveals base64-encoded data that is concatenated and then executed via exec(). This pattern of decoding obfuscated data and executing it dynamically is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code uses base64 decoding to hide its true payload and then executes it without any user interaction or consent. Such behavior is typical of malware that attempts to evade static analysis and deliver arbitrary code execution. The absence of any legitimate application logic, combined with the use of exec on decoded data, confirms that this code contains malicious behavior."
