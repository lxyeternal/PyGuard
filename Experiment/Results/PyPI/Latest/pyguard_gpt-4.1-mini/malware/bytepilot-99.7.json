      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes a main() function from a module named 'main'. This means arbitrary code execution occurs at install time without user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. Executing code during package installation is a known hallmark of malicious packages, especially when the executed code is not part of the standard installation or build process. The setup script does not provide any indication of legitimate application logic justifying this behavior, nor does it show any user prompts or validation. This pattern aligns with the critical risk indicator of arbitrary code execution during package installation, which is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent and sends this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs. The domains used (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) are non-standard and appear to be related to out-of-band (OAST) testing or data exfiltration services, which are commonly abused for malicious data leakage. The code performs this network communication silently without user interaction or notification, and the data sent includes potentially sensitive system identifiers. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with unsolicited data exfiltration to suspicious external endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with known malware behaviors for reconnaissance and information theft."
