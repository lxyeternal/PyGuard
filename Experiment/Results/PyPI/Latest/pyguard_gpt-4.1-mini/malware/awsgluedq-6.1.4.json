      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/awsgluedq) immediately upon execution and also during the package installation process via a custom install command. This behavior triggers network communication without user interaction or consent, embedded in the setup.py installation script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The domain 'pov.sh' is not associated with the package's stated purpose or a known legitimate service, indicating potential data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The code lacks any legitimate application logic surrounding the network calls, no user notification or validation is present, and the network activity is triggered automatically during installation, which is a critical risk pattern strongly associated with malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious, non-standard URL 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/awsgluedq' without any user interaction, consent, or legitimate application context. The domain 'pov.sh' with a non-standard port and an obscure API path is indicative of a potentially malicious or command-and-control endpoint. This pattern aligns with typical malicious behavior involving unsolicited network communication to suspicious external servers, which is a common vector for data exfiltration, remote command retrieval, or staging further payloads. The absence of any legitimate application logic, error handling, or user notification further increases suspicion. Therefore, this code snippet exhibits characteristics consistent with malicious activity."
