      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method. In this overridden run method, after calling the original install.run(self), it dynamically imports a main() function from a module named 'main' and immediately executes it during the package installation process. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution as a side effect of installing the package, without any user interaction or consent. Executing code during installation is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious activity. Although the code snippet itself does not show network communication or obfuscation, the dynamic import and execution of code during install is a critical risk pattern for malware, as it can be used to run arbitrary payloads, exfiltrate data, or deploy further malicious components. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior due to its execution of arbitrary code at install time."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system-specific information such as hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent and sends this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs. The domains used (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun') are non-standard and appear to be associated with out-of-band interaction testing or potentially malicious data collection. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this data exfiltration. The code performs automated network communication to these endpoints, which is a classic indicator of information-stealing or reconnaissance malware behavior. Although the code does not execute downloaded content or perform obfuscation, the unsolicited collection and transmission of sensitive environment data to suspicious external servers is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
