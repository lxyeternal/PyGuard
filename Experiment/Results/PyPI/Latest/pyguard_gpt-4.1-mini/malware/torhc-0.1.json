      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (PostInstallCommand) that overrides the standard install process in setup.py. During installation, it executes shell commands via subprocess.run without user consent or notification. It reconstructs a hardcoded, obfuscated URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoneroOcean/xmrig_setup/master/setup_moneroocean_miner.sh) and runs a shell command that downloads and executes a remote shell script silently (stdout and stderr redirected to DEVNULL). This behavior is a classic supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is executed during package installation to fetch and run potentially harmful payloads from an external source. The obfuscation of strings, suppression of exceptions, lack of validation or user interaction, and execution of remote code during install are strong indicators of malicious intent. The URL points to a script related to Monero mining, suggesting unauthorized cryptocurrency mining payload delivery. This pattern is a well-known hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks in Python packages."
