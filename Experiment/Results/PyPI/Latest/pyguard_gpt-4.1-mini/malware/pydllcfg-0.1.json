      "malicious_behavior": "The code overrides the setuptools install command to execute arbitrary shell commands during package installation without user consent. Specifically, it downloads an executable file (CBLines.exe) from a hardcoded, non-standard URL (https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe) directly to the current working directory. After downloading, it immediately executes this file using PowerShell's Start-Process. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution on the victim's system during package installation. The lack of validation, user notification, or integrity checks on the downloaded executable, combined with the automatic execution of a potentially untrusted binary, strongly indicates malicious intent. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as arbitrary code execution at install time, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, execution of downloaded executables without user interaction, and abuse of the installation process for payload delivery."
