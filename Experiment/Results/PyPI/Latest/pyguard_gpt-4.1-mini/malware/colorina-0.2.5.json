      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information including username, computer name, hardware UUID, and public IP address without user consent. It searches for Discord tokens in local storage directories of Discord and various browsers, which are sensitive credentials. It attempts to extract saved browser passwords from Chrome's local SQLite database, encoding the encrypted passwords in base64, indicating credential theft. It also searches for Minecraft account credentials in known client configuration files. All this sensitive data is exfiltrated by sending HTTP POST requests to multiple hardcoded Discord webhook URLs, which are base64-encoded to obfuscate their presence. The use of multiple webhook URLs with fallback attempts suggests an intent to ensure data exfiltration. The code performs these actions silently, with exception suppression, no user interaction, and no legitimate application logic. The combination of environment discovery, credential harvesting, obfuscated hardcoded external endpoints, and automated data exfiltration to attacker-controlled webhooks is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
