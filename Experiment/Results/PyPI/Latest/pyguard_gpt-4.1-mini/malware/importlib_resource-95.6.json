      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method. In this method, after running the standard install process, it dynamically imports a main() function from a module named 'main' and immediately executes it during package installation. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time without user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The package name 'importlib_resource' and version '95.6' appear suspicious and may be an attempt at typosquatting or masquerading as a legitimate package. The install_requires includes 'requests' and 'psutil', which are common libraries used in malware for network communication and system information gathering, although their presence alone is not conclusive. The key malicious indicator is the execution of arbitrary code (main()) during installation, which can be abused to run any payload, including downloading and executing further malicious code, exfiltrating data, or establishing persistence. This pattern is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks in Python ecosystems. There is no evidence of user consent, validation, or safe execution context. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic surrounding this network activity. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before transmission is a common tactic to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard and appear to be related to out-of-band (OAST) testing or exfiltration infrastructure, which is often abused by malware for data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The code silently suppresses all exceptions during network communication, further indicating an attempt to avoid detection. Collecting and exfiltrating sensitive system identifiers without user consent to suspicious external endpoints is a hallmark of malicious behavior, typically associated with information-stealing or reconnaissance malware."
