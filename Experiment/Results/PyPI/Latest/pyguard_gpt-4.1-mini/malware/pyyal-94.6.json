      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and executes the main() function from a module named 'main' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time, which is a well-known supply chain attack vector. Executing code during package installation without explicit user approval is a critical risk and a hallmark of malicious packages. Although the provided snippet does not show the contents of the 'main' module, the pattern of executing code on install via a custom install command is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks. This technique can be used to run arbitrary payloads, download further malware, or perform unauthorized actions on the victim's system. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before exfiltration is a common tactic in malware to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard and appear to be related to out-of-band (OAST) testing or potentially attacker-controlled infrastructure. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The overall pattern matches known malicious behavior of system fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers without user consent or notification."
