      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed environment information from the host system, including environment variables (os.environ), the output of the 'env' shell command, and the contents of '/proc/self/environ'. It encodes this information in Base64 and sends it via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://csnr59g8cumhnf5tp4f0icgnzge434rpa.oast.fun) without any user interaction or consent. The use of a non-standard, likely attacker-controlled domain for exfiltration, combined with the automated collection and transmission of sensitive system environment data, is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this behavior, and the code attempts to gather as much environment data as possible for exfiltration. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including environment discovery, data encoding to evade detection, and exfiltration to a suspicious external endpoint."
