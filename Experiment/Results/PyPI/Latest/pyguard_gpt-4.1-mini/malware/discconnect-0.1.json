      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a setup.py script that, upon package installation, downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://filetransfer.io/data-package/MG85ggQt/download) and saves it to the user's LOCALAPPDATA directory as 'Driver.exe'. It then immediately executes this downloaded file using the Windows API call WinExec without any user interaction, consent, validation, or integrity checks. This pattern—downloading and executing an external binary during package installation from an untrusted source—is a classic supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. The use of a hardcoded URL to fetch an executable, writing it to a system/user directory, and executing it silently during installation without transparency or user notification are critical risk indicators of malicious behavior. There is no legitimate application logic or user-driven action justifying this behavior, and it bypasses normal security controls by embedding payload delivery and execution in the installation process."
