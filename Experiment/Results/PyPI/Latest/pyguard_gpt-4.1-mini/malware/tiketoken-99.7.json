      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes a main() function from a module named 'main'. This means arbitrary code execution occurs automatically upon package installation without user interaction or consent. Executing code during package installation is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The dynamic import and execution of main() in the install hook is suspicious because it bypasses normal user control and can be used to run arbitrary or harmful payloads. Although the code itself does not show network activity or obfuscation, the pattern of executing code at install time from an external module is a critical risk indicator of malware, as it enables attackers to run arbitrary code on the victim system during package installation. This behavior matches the known malicious pattern of code execution embedded in setup/install scripts, which is a common technique in malicious PyPI packages and supply chain attacks."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent. It then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names that are not associated with any legitimate service. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with unsolicited data exfiltration to hardcoded, non-standard domains is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this behavior. The use of random query parameters and multiple obscure endpoints further suggests an attempt to evade detection or tracking. According to the provided knowledge points, such unsolicited environment discovery and data exfiltration to suspicious external servers is a hallmark of information-stealing or staging malware."
