      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It executes shell commands during package setup without user consent to collect system information (hostname, current user, network configuration) and appends environment variables (likely containing sensitive data such as private keys and metadata) to a temporary file. It then immediately exfiltrates this collected data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external IP address (http://61.28.229.27). This sequence of environment variable access, file writing, shell command execution, and network exfiltration during package installation is a classic pattern of malware, often used in supply chain attacks to steal sensitive information from the victim's system. The use of os.system for command execution, hardcoded IP for data exfiltration, and absence of any legitimate application logic or user interaction further confirm the malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. Specifically, in the EOSIOKey class constructor (__init__), it imports subprocess and requests modules and immediately executes the following suspicious actions without any user interaction or consent: it runs shell commands to collect system information (hostname, current user, and network configuration) and writes the output to a temporary file (/tmp/r). Then, it performs an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://61.28.229.27), uploading the collected system information file. This sequence is a classic example of unauthorized data exfiltration, where sensitive host environment details are gathered and sent to a remote server controlled by an attacker. The use of hardcoded IP, absence of legitimate application logic around this network activity, no error handling, and no user notification or consent strongly indicate malicious intent. The rest of the code implements cryptographic key handling and signing functionality, which appears benign and related to EOSIO blockchain keys, but the embedded data exfiltration in the constructor is a critical risk and hallmark of malware."
