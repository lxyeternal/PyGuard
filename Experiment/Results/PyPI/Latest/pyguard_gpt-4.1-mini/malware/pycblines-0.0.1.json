It saves this executable in the current working directory and then immediately executes it silently using PowerShell. This pattern of downloading and executing a remote executable without user notification or integrity checks is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution. The use of subprocess to run PowerShell commands to download and run an executable from an external source is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's system. There is no legitimate application logic or user-driven workflow justifying this behavior, and the code lacks error handling or security measures. Therefore, this code is highly suspicious and should be classified as malicious."

This pattern of downloading and executing a remote executable without user consent or validation is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution. The use of subprocess to run PowerShell commands to download and execute the file further supports the malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding these actions, and the URL points to a non-standard location for executable delivery. Therefore, this code exhibits critical risk behavior consistent with malware."
