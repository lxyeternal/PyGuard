This behavior is a classic indicator of malicious activity, as it enables remote code execution of potentially untrusted payloads. The download-and-execute pattern embedded directly in the setup script (which runs during package installation) is a known supply chain attack vector, allowing arbitrary code execution on the victim's system without notification or validation. The absence of error handling or user prompts, combined with the use of a non-standard URL and execution of a downloaded executable, strongly indicates malicious intent."
