      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes a main() function from a module named 'main'. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time without user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. Executing code during package installation is a known hallmark of malicious packages, especially when the executed code is not part of the standard installation or build process. The code does not show any legitimate build or compilation logic, nor does it provide user notification or validation before executing the imported main() function. This pattern aligns with the critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution during package installation, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, username, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names that do not correspond to any known legitimate service. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with unsolicited data exfiltration to external, non-standard domains is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The absence of legitimate application logic, user notification, or error handling that would justify such network communication further supports this conclusion. The use of random query parameters and multiple obscure endpoints suggests an attempt to evade detection or tracking. Overall, this behavior aligns with known malware patterns of system reconnaissance and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers."
