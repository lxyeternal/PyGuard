      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class (CustomInstall) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://py.chain2.eyes.sh/) without any user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic. This network call is embedded directly in the package installation process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Although some potentially sensitive environment data collection code (hostname, cwd, username) is commented out, the presence of the external request during install time to a non-standard domain strongly indicates an attempt to perform system fingerprinting or data exfiltration. The use of a hardcoded, non-corporate domain in an install hook with no transparency or user notification is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks and unauthorized data exfiltration."
