      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that executes during the package installation process (setup.py). It collects detailed system information including OS details (via uname or systeminfo), current working directory, local IP configuration, public IP (via curl to ifconfig.me), current user (whoami), and hostname. It then sends all this sensitive system information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. This behavior constitutes automated, unsolicited data exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment and system fingerprinting information without user consent or notification. The code executes this data collection and exfiltration immediately upon package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for data exfiltration, combined with the lack of any legitimate application logic or user interaction, strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as execution of shell commands during install, environment discovery, and immediate outbound HTTP POST to a suspicious hardcoded endpoint, all without user consent or transparency."
