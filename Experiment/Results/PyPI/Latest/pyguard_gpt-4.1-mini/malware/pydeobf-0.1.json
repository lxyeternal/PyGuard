      "malicious_behavior": "The code overrides the setuptools install command to perform unauthorized actions during package installation without user consent. Specifically, it downloads an executable file (CBLines.exe) from a hardcoded, non-standard URL (https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe) directly to the current working directory. After downloading, it immediately executes this file using PowerShell's Start-Process. This pattern—downloading and executing an external executable during package installation—is a classic supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. The code lacks any validation, user notification, or integrity checks on the downloaded file, increasing the risk of arbitrary code execution. The use of subprocess with shell=True to run PowerShell commands further facilitates stealthy execution. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators, including execution of remote payloads during install, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, and execution of downloaded executables without user interaction or consent."
