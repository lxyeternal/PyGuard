      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior because it executes network communication during the package installation process without user consent or interaction. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to run a post-install hook that sends system-specific information (hostname and OS type) along with the public IP address to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55). This behavior is a classic example of environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration embedded in a package installation script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded suspicious webhook URL, automatic data exfiltration on install, and lack of legitimate application logic or user notification strongly indicate malicious intent."
