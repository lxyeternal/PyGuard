      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. Specifically, it collects system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, non-standard IP address (http://192.198.82.14:3000/log) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic example of environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration embedded in a package installation process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded IP address for data exfiltration, lack of legitimate application logic surrounding the network activity, and execution of network communication during install time without user notification or consent are strong indicators of malicious intent. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware and supply chain attacks."
