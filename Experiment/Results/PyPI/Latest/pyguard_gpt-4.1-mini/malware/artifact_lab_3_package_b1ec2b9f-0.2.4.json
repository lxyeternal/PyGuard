      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects the entire environment variables of the host system, encodes them in base64, and sends them via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://fopdbzseohtgcssjzenyswebrkpo7g68i.oast.fun). This behavior is a classic indicator of information exfiltration. The domain is non-standard and appears to be a testing or attacker-controlled domain (oast.fun is commonly used for out-of-band interaction testing). The code performs no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic before sending potentially sensitive environment data externally. It also encodes the output of a shell command ('env') and sends it similarly, further indicating system information gathering and exfiltration. These patterns align with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including environment variable access, base64 encoding for obfuscation, and transmission to a suspicious hardcoded external endpoint without user consent or legitimate purpose."
