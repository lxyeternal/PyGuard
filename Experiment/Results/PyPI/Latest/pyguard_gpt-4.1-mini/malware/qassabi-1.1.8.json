      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. Specifically, it collects system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external IP address (http://192.198.82.14:3000/log) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic example of environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration embedded in a package installation script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded IP address rather than a legitimate domain, the lack of any legitimate application logic surrounding the network call, and the execution of network communication during install time without user notification or validation strongly indicate malicious intent. This pattern aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as exfiltration of sensitive system information, execution of code during package installation, and use of hardcoded suspicious endpoints. Therefore, this code is malicious."
