      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes a main() function from a module named 'main'. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time without user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. Executing code during package installation is a known hallmark of malicious packages, especially when the executed code is not part of the standard installation or build process. The code does not show any legitimate build or compilation steps, nor does it provide user notification or validation before executing the imported main() function. This pattern aligns with the critical risk indicator of arbitrary code execution during package installation, which is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system-specific information such as hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent and sends this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs. The domains used (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun') are non-standard and appear to be related to out-of-band (OAST) testing or potentially attacker-controlled endpoints. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this data collection and transmission. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with unsolicited data exfiltration to hardcoded suspicious domains is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or reconnaissance malware behavior."
