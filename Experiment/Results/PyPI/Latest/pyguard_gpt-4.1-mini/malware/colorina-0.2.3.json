      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information including username, computer name, hardware UUID, and public IP address without user consent. It searches for Discord tokens in local storage files, which are sensitive credentials that can be abused for account hijacking. It attempts to extract saved browser passwords from Chrome's local SQLite database, encoding the encrypted passwords in base64, indicating credential theft. It also searches for Minecraft account credentials in local configuration files. All this sensitive data is then exfiltrated to multiple hardcoded Discord webhook URLs, which are base64-encoded and decoded at runtime to evade detection. The use of multiple webhooks for data exfiltration, combined with the silent exception handling and lack of user interaction, strongly indicates this is an information-stealing malware. The code uses obfuscation techniques (base64 encoding of URLs), targets sensitive user data, and sends it to attacker-controlled endpoints without any legitimate purpose or user consent. These behaviors align with known malicious patterns such as credential theft, system fingerprinting, and data exfiltration to external command-and-control servers."
