      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in a Python package setup script that executes a shell command during the package installation process without user interaction or consent. Specifically, it runs a curl POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://enj2782rxwxl.x.pipedream.net/) sending sensitive system information including the current username (whoami), hostname, present working directory (pwd), and public IP address (retrieved via curl to ifconfig.me). This behavior is a classic example of data exfiltration embedded in a package installation script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of os.system to run shell commands during install, the hardcoded external endpoint unrelated to the package's stated purpose, and the collection and transmission of sensitive environment data without user consent are all strong indicators of malicious intent."
