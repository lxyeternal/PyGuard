      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method. In this overridden run method, after running the standard install process, it dynamically imports a main() function from a module named 'main' and immediately executes it during the package installation. This pattern of executing arbitrary code at install time without user interaction or consent is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The dynamic import and execution of main() during installation can be used to run arbitrary, potentially harmful code on the user's system as part of the package installation process. Although the provided snippet does not show the contents of the 'main' module, the fact that code execution is triggered automatically during installation is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent. This behavior violates best practices for benign packages, which should not execute arbitrary code during installation. Therefore, this code is considered malicious due to its use of a post-install hook to execute code without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent and sends this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs. The domains used (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) are non-standard and resemble domains commonly used for out-of-band interaction testing or data exfiltration. The code performs this network communication silently without user interaction or notification, which is a typical pattern of information-stealing malware. Although the code does not execute downloaded content or spawn shells, the unsolicited collection and exfiltration of system identifying information to suspicious external endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
