      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It fetches remote payloads from a hardcoded suspicious URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xe2d0/evil-pip/main/scripts/linux.txt and windows.txt) without any user interaction or consent. These payloads are reverse shell scripts designed to connect back to a hardcoded attacker IP (10.0.0.1) and port (4444), enabling unauthorized remote access. The code dynamically replaces IP and port placeholders in the payload and executes the payload immediately in the background using subprocess.Popen with Python interpreters, effectively spawning reverse shells on both Linux and Windows platforms. This execution happens during package installation (setup.py context), which is a known supply chain attack vector. There is no validation, user notification, or error handling around the network fetch or execution, increasing the risk. The use of hardcoded IP, direct execution of downloaded code, and reverse shell payloads are classic hallmarks of malware, specifically remote access trojans (RATs) or backdoors. The package metadata also misleadingly describes the package as 'Malicious Python Package' authored by 'GodMi4G' with a suspicious GitHub URL, further confirming malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to compromise victim machines by establishing unauthorized remote shells, making it definitively malicious."
