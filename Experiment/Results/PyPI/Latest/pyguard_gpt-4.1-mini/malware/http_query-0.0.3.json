      "malicious_behavior": "The code reads AWS credentials from the user's home directory (~/.aws/credentials), extracts sensitive information such as aws_access_key_id and aws_secret_access_key from all sections, and immediately sends this sensitive data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://eo64g38fdes1lxm.m.pipedream.net) without any user interaction, consent, or notification. This behavior constitutes unauthorized credential harvesting and exfiltration of sensitive secrets to an attacker-controlled endpoint, which is a classic and critical indicator of malicious activity. The use of a hardcoded suspicious webhook URL, combined with the immediate transmission of sensitive credentials, aligns with known patterns of information-stealing malware. Additionally, the code does not perform any validation, logging, or error handling around this exfiltration, further indicating malicious intent."
