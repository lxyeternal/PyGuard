      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in setup.py that takes a screenshot of the user's screen using PIL's ImageGrab module during package installation, then sends this screenshot image via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This behavior occurs automatically during the installation process without any user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL (discord.com API webhook) for exfiltrating potentially sensitive user data (screenshots) is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code installs required packages dynamically via subprocess during installation, which can be abused to ensure dependencies for malicious actions. The screenshot capture and exfiltration during install time, combined with the hardcoded external endpoint and lack of user notification, matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including data exfiltration, unauthorized network communication, and execution of code during package installation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
