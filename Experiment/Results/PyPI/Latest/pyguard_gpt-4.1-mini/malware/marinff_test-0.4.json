      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute a reverse shell payload immediately upon package installation. Specifically, it constructs a Python reverse shell command that attempts to connect back to a hardcoded IP address (192.168.239.158) on port 1234. The payload duplicates the socket file descriptor to stdin, stdout, and stderr, spawns a bash shell, and suppresses shell history logging. The reverse shell command is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed via a shell command using os.system. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malicious code, enabling unauthorized remote access to the victim's machine without user consent or interaction. Embedding such a payload in the install process of a Python package is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of hardcoded IP, base64 encoding to obfuscate the payload, execution during installation, and spawning of a remote shell are all critical risk indicators of malware."
