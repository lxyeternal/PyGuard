      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a post-install function 'run_after_install' that decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it dynamically using exec(). The encoded string 'cHJpbnQoInRlc3QiKQ==' decodes to 'print(\"test\")', which is benign in this example. However, the pattern of embedding base64-encoded code and executing it during package installation is a well-known supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. Executing arbitrary code at install time without user consent or validation is a critical risk. This technique is commonly used by malware to hide payloads, evade detection, and execute arbitrary commands on the victim system. Even though the current payload is harmless, the structure enables easy replacement with malicious code, making this pattern highly suspicious and typically associated with malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses base64 decoding to decode a string and then immediately executes it with exec(). This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the actual code being run, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The decoded string is 'print(\"test\")', which itself is benign, but the pattern of base64 decoding followed by exec() is a critical risk indicator for malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution from obfuscated sources. Such patterns are commonly used by malware to evade static analysis and hide malicious payloads. Even though the decoded payload here is harmless, the use of exec() on base64-decoded data is a hallmark of malicious code and should be treated as suspicious or potentially malicious in real-world scenarios."
