      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method. In this overridden run method, after running the standard install process, it dynamically imports a main() function from a module named 'main' and immediately executes it during the package installation. This pattern of executing arbitrary code at install time without user interaction or consent is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The dynamic import and immediate execution of code during installation can be used to run arbitrary payloads, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. Although the provided snippet does not show the contents of the 'main' module, the installation hook itself is a critical risk indicator for malicious intent, as it enables arbitrary code execution during package installation, which is a common technique used by malware in Python ecosystems."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding before exfiltration is a known obfuscation technique to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard, suspicious, and likely attacker-controlled. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The overall behavior matches classic indicators of malicious activity, specifically system fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers without user consent or legitimate purpose."
