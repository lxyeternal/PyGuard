      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports a function named execute_code_from_github from a module named humans and attempts to call it (though the call is incomplete). The function name strongly suggests that it fetches and executes code from GitHub, which implies dynamic code execution from a remote source. This pattern is a critical risk indicator because executing code fetched from the internet without validation or user consent is a well-known vector for malware delivery and remote code execution attacks. The presence of the requests module import further supports the likelihood of network activity. Although the code snippet is incomplete and does not explicitly show the execution, the intent to execute remote code dynamically is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially given the function name and import context. This matches the critical risk patterns of arbitrary code execution from untrusted remote sources, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically fetches Python code from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrunknown12321/1234/refs/heads/main/1234) without any user interaction, validation, or consent, and immediately executes it using exec(). This pattern is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior because it enables arbitrary code execution from an untrusted remote source, which can lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. The code also attempts to install the 'requests' module if not present, which facilitates the network request and execution of remote code. There is no error handling or logging that would inform the user of these actions, and the URL is non-standard and suspicious. This behavior matches multiple critical risk patterns, including remote payload retrieval and unsupervised dynamic code execution, which are hallmark techniques of malware."
