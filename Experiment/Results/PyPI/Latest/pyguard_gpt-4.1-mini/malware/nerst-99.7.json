      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system-specific information such as hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent and sends this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that do not correspond to any known legitimate service. The URLs have unusual domain names and subdomains, which are typical indicators of command-and-control or data exfiltration endpoints. The code performs these network requests automatically upon execution without any user interaction or notification, which is a common pattern in malware for system fingerprinting and data exfiltration. Although the code does not execute downloaded content or spawn shells, the unsolicited collection and transmission of environment data to suspicious external servers strongly indicates malicious intent."
