      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class PreferredSettings that overrides the setuptools install command. During installation, it silently downloads a Python script from a hardcoded external URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) without any user interaction or consent. It writes this downloaded content directly to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py). Then, it attempts to append a command to execute this script (\"python ~/.fleetwood.py\") to the user's shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) if not already present, thereby establishing persistence by ensuring the script runs on every new shell session. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, avoiding detection. This pattern of downloading and writing executable code from an external source during package installation, combined with modifying user shell configuration files to execute that code persistently, is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification justifying these actions. Therefore, this code exhibits critical risk malicious behavior."
