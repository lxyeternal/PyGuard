      "malicious_behavior": "The code subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command in setup.py, which is a known vector for executing code during package installation without user consent. In the overridden run() method, after running the original install, it collects environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (aeknnnsitysuxpmwevwu8f0o55ek42w0f.oast.fun). This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: execution of network communication during package installation, exfiltration of system-specific information (hostname, cwd, username) to a suspicious external endpoint, use of a hardcoded non-standard URL unrelated to the package's stated purpose, and lack of user interaction or notification. The code does not perform any legitimate application logic around this network activity, indicating it is designed for covert data exfiltration as part of a supply chain attack or malicious package. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
