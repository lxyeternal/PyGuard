      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-awsglue) immediately upon execution and also during the package installation process via a custom install command subclass. This behavior triggers network communication without user interaction or consent, embedded in the setup/install script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The domain pov.sh is not a standard or trusted Python package source, and the request is made without any legitimate application logic or user notification. The code exploits the setuptools install hook to execute network communication during package installation, which is a critical risk pattern associated exclusively with malware. There is no validation, error handling, or explanation for the network call, indicating potential data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. This pattern aligns with known malicious behaviors such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or staging for further payload delivery, making the code malicious."

The domain 'pov.sh' and the unusual port and path strongly suggest a non-standard endpoint likely controlled by an attacker. This pattern of silent network communication to a suspicious hardcoded URL is a common indicator of malicious behavior, potentially for data exfiltration, command-and-control communication, or remote payload retrieval. There is no legitimate application logic or error handling surrounding this network call, increasing suspicion. According to the provided knowledge points, such unsolicited network communication to suspicious hardcoded URLs without user consent or context is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
