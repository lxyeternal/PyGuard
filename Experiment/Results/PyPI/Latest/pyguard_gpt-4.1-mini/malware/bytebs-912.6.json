      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and executes the main() function from a module named 'main' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Executing code during package installation without explicit user approval is a critical risk pattern strongly associated with malware. Although the code snippet itself does not show network activity or obfuscation, the dynamic import and execution of external code during installation is suspicious and can be abused to run malicious payloads. This pattern enables attackers to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system as part of the trusted package installation workflow, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent and sends this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs. The domains used (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) are non-standard and resemble domains commonly used for out-of-band interaction testing or data exfiltration. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this data collection and transmission. The code performs automated network communication to these suspicious endpoints, which is a strong indicator of information-stealing or reconnaissance malware behavior. Although the code does not execute downloaded content or perform obfuscated operations, the unsolicited collection and exfiltration of system identifying information to suspicious external servers without user consent classifies this as malicious behavior."
