      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class 'gpl' that overrides the 'run' method to execute additional code during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Inside the 'run' method, it contains an obfuscated string 'l' that is decoded using a ROT13-like cipher to produce a string 'h'. The code then reads the '/etc/passwd' file line by line, parsing each line to find entries where the third colon-separated field equals '1000' (commonly the user ID of the first non-root user). For each such user, it attempts to open and append the decoded string 'h' to the user's '.profile' file located at '/home/{username}/.profile'. This behavior effectively injects hidden or malicious code into user profile scripts, which will execute when the user logs in or starts a shell session, enabling persistence or further malicious actions. The entire operation is wrapped in a try-except block that suppresses all exceptions, indicating an attempt to avoid detection or failure logging. This code executes automatically during package installation without user consent or notification, fulfilling multiple high-risk malicious behavior patterns such as obfuscation, execution during install, targeting sensitive user files, and persistence establishment. Therefore, this code is malicious."
