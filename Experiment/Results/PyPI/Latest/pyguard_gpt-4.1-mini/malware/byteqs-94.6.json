      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes a main() function from a module named 'main'. This behavior triggers code execution at install time without explicit user interaction or consent, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Executing arbitrary code during package installation is a critical risk pattern strongly associated with malware, as it can lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further payload deployment. Although the provided snippet does not show the contents of the 'main' module, the pattern of dynamic import and immediate execution during installation is a hallmark of malicious intent, especially in the context of Python packages. The presence of this pattern alone is sufficient to classify the code as malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding for the MAC addresses before exfiltration is a known obfuscation technique to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard, suspicious, and likely attacker-controlled, indicating command-and-control or data exfiltration infrastructure. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The overall pattern matches a classic information-stealing or system fingerprinting malware behavior, where environment and user data are collected and exfiltrated to attacker-controlled servers without user knowledge or consent. Therefore, this code is malicious."
