It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, non-standard, private IP address (http://10.0.2.15:8080), which is suspicious and indicative of data exfiltration. This network communication occurs immediately upon execution, embedded in the setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks and remote code execution. The use of os.popen to run a shell command to get the public IP, combined with sending detailed system fingerprinting data to a hardcoded external endpoint during package installation, matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including unsolicited data exfiltration, lack of user consent, and embedding malicious activity in the package setup process. Therefore, this code is malicious."
