      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an unsolicited HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (2fi5gkleg5tmgwm7weol7js11s7lvdj2.oastify.com), which is indicative of network communication to a potentially attacker-controlled server without user consent or interaction. It also collects system information such as OS details (os.uname()) and current working directory (os.getcwd()), which are typical environment fingerprinting actions used in reconnaissance or data exfiltration. Although the Discord webhook sending lines are commented out, their presence suggests intent to exfiltrate system information to an external Discord server. The use of a non-standard, suspicious domain for network communication combined with environment data collection and potential exfiltration aligns with multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, including unsolicited data exfiltration and remote command-and-control communication. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying these actions, and the code lacks error handling or transparency. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware."
