      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes the main() function from a module named 'main'. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time without explicit user interaction or consent, which is a known high-risk and critical pattern commonly associated with supply chain attacks and malicious packages. The dynamic import and execution of code during package installation is a classic vector for malware delivery, enabling attackers to run arbitrary payloads on the victim's system under the guise of a legitimate package installation. Although the provided snippet does not show the contents of the 'main' module, the pattern of executing code during install is itself a strong indicator of malicious intent, especially given the absence of any benign justification or user prompts. This technique is widely recognized as a critical risk and hallmark of malicious Python packages."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names that do not correspond to any known legitimate services. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic surrounding this network activity. The use of base64 encoding before transmission is a common obfuscation technique to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard and appear to be designed for data exfiltration or command-and-control purposes. The code silently suppresses all exceptions during network communication, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. Collecting and exfiltrating system fingerprinting data to suspicious external endpoints without user consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, often associated with information-stealing malware or staging for further attacks."
