      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command that downloads a file named 'pytorch' from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (122.51.221.63) using wget, makes it executable, and runs it in the background with nohup. This pattern is a classic indicator of malicious behavior: it fetches and executes potentially untrusted code from an external source without any user interaction, validation, or consent. The use of a raw IP address instead of a legitimate domain, combined with immediate execution of the downloaded file, strongly suggests a remote payload retrieval and execution attack vector. There is no legitimate application logic or error handling surrounding this operation, and it matches multiple critical risk indicators such as hardcoded suspicious URL, download-and-execute pattern, and unsupervised shell command execution. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
