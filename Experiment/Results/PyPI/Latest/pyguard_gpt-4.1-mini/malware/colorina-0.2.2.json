      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive user and system information including username, computer name, hardware UUID, and public IP address without user consent. It searches for Discord tokens in local storage files, which are sensitive authentication tokens, and extracts saved browser passwords from Chrome's local SQLite database, encoding them in base64. It also attempts to read Minecraft account credentials from local configuration files. All this sensitive data is then exfiltrated by sending it via HTTP POST requests to four hardcoded, base64-encoded Discord webhook URLs, which decode to suspicious external endpoints (discordapp.com webhooks). The use of base64 encoding to hide the webhook URLs is a common obfuscation technique to evade detection. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying these actions. The code silently suppresses exceptions to avoid detection and does not perform any validation or notification before exfiltration. Collecting and sending Discord tokens, browser passwords, and game account credentials to attacker-controlled webhooks is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to steal sensitive credentials and system information for unauthorized use or exploitation."
