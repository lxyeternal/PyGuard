      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in setup.py that executes a function 'send' immediately after package installation. This function sends an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55) with query parameters containing the local machine's hostname and operating system information. This behavior constitutes system fingerprinting and data exfiltration without user consent or interaction. The use of a hardcoded suspicious external URL in a post-install hook to silently transmit system-specific data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attack patterns. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this network call during installation, no user notification, and no error handling, increasing the risk. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior by performing unauthorized data exfiltration triggered automatically during package installation."
