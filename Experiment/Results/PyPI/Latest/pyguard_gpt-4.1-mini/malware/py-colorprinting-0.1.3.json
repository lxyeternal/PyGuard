      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a ZIP file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://cosmoplanets.net/well-known/pki-validation/ore-miner.zip) without any user interaction or consent. It writes this file to the system's temporary directory, extracts its contents, and then executes an executable named 'ore-miner.exe' from the extracted folder using subprocess.Popen with flags to hide the window (creationflags combining 0x200 and 0x8). The entire operation is wrapped in try-except blocks that suppress all exceptions, which is a common evasion technique. The execution is launched in a separate thread immediately upon import or execution, indicating stealthy background activity. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network fetch and execution. These behaviors—downloading and executing an untrusted binary from a suspicious URL, running it hidden in the background, suppressing errors, and using threading to evade detection—are classic hallmarks of malware, such as a downloader or dropper component. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
