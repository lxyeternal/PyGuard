      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a Python package setup script that subclasses the setuptools install command to execute a post-install function immediately after installation. This post-install function takes a screenshot of the user's current screen using PIL's ImageGrab, then sends the screenshot image via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This behavior occurs silently during package installation without any user interaction or consent. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for exfiltrating potentially sensitive user screen content is a clear data exfiltration vector. The code triggers network communication and sensitive data capture as a side effect of package installation, which is a known supply chain attack pattern. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this behavior, no user notification or opt-in, and the webhook URL is external and unrelated to the package's stated purpose. According to the provided knowledge points, this pattern of automatic data capture and exfiltration during install time, especially to a hardcoded external endpoint, is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
