      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in setup.py that executes a function 'send' immediately after package installation without any user interaction or consent. This function collects system-specific information including the hostname (platform.node()), operating system (platform.system()), and the public IP address (retrieved via a GET request to 'https://api.ipify.org'). It then constructs a URL with this data appended as a query parameter and sends an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55). This behavior is a classic example of system fingerprinting and data exfiltration during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL unrelated to the package's stated purpose, the absence of user notification or consent, and the automatic execution of network communication during installation are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as unsolicited collection and exfiltration of sensitive system information, execution of network requests in post-install hooks, and use of suspicious hardcoded URLs. Therefore, the code contains malicious behavior."
