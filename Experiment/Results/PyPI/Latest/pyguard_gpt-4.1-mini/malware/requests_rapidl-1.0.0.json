      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code is designed to collect detailed user and system information (username, hostname, OS type and version, private and public IP addresses, approximate geolocation) during the package installation process without explicit user consent. It then sends this collected data as a JSON payload to a hardcoded external server IP address (http://38.181.219.70:5000/collect) via an HTTP POST request. The data collection and exfiltration are triggered automatically as a post-install hook in the setuptools installation process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Although the code explicitly states it does not collect passwords, it still gathers sensitive environment and network information that can be used for fingerprinting, tracking, or further malicious purposes. The use of a hardcoded IP address and port, the automatic data exfiltration during installation without user interaction or consent, and the embedding of this behavior in the package's install command classify this as malicious behavior. This pattern aligns with known malware tactics of information stealing and covert data exfiltration during package installation, a critical risk indicator in supply chain attacks."
