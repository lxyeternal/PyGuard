      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects the user's public IP address and detailed geolocation and device information via external API calls, then sends this information along with user input and AI-generated responses to a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID. This behavior constitutes unsolicited data exfiltration of potentially sensitive user environment information without explicit user consent or notification. Additionally, the code communicates with hardcoded IP addresses (104.236.72.47) for AI response generation, which are not standard or verified trusted endpoints. The use of a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID to send collected data externally is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables covert data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled channel. There is no user interaction or consent before these network actions, and the code lacks transparency or legitimate application logic justifying this data transmission. These factors align with typical malicious patterns of information stealing and unauthorized data exfiltration."
