      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded string assigned to __safety_token__, which decodes to a Python expression that imports the 'urllib3' module, creates a PoolManager, and performs an HTTP GET request to a suspicious hardcoded URL (https://pastebin.com/raw/b47g1z9z), then accesses the .data attribute of the response. This is a classic pattern of obfuscated network communication to a non-standard, suspicious external URL without user interaction or consent. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL and the request code is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it attempts to evade static analysis. The code dynamically constructs and likely executes this decoded data (implied by the naming __safety_token__ and the pattern), which is a hallmark of malware behavior involving remote payload retrieval and execution. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with remote code fetching and potential execution from an untrusted external source."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically imports the 'threading' module and immediately starts a new thread that executes code via exec(). The executed code is obtained by calling the function 't' on '__safety_token__', both imported from a relative module named '__version__'. This pattern of dynamically executing code in a separate thread without any user interaction or validation is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of exec() on data that is likely obfuscated or encoded (given the naming '__safety_token__' and function 't') is a classic technique to hide and execute arbitrary payloads, bypassing static analysis and detection. The immediate spawning of a thread to run this exec() call further suggests an attempt to evade detection and run code covertly. There is no legitimate application logic or user consent evident, and the code structure aligns with known malware patterns involving dynamic code execution and stealthy payload deployment."
