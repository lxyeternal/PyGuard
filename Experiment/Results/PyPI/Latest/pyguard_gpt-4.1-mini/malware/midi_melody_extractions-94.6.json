      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes the main() function from a module named 'main'. This behavior triggers code execution at install time without explicit user interaction or consent, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Executing arbitrary code during package installation is a critical risk pattern strongly associated with malware, as it can lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further payload deployment. Although the code snippet itself does not show obfuscation or network activity, the dynamic import and execution of code during installation is a hallmark of malicious intent, especially in the context of Python packages. This pattern is widely recognized as a high-severity threat and is commonly exploited in malicious PyPI packages to execute arbitrary payloads on the victim's system."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic surrounding this network activity. The use of base64 encoding for the MAC addresses before transmission is a common obfuscation tactic to evade detection. The domains used are not standard or known legitimate services and resemble domains used for out-of-band interaction or data exfiltration in penetration testing or malware. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The overall behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including environment discovery, data encoding, and exfiltration to suspicious hardcoded endpoints without user consent or legitimate purpose."
