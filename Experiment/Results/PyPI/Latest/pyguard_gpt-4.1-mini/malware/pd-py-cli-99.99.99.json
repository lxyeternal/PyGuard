      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that executes during the package installation process (subclassing setuptools.command.install.install). During installation, it collects detailed system information including OS details (via uname or systeminfo), current working directory, local IP configuration, public IP (via curl to ifconfig.me), current user (whoami), and hostname. It then immediately sends all this collected sensitive system and user information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external Slack webhook URL. This exfiltration of sensitive environment and system data without user consent or notification, triggered automatically during package installation, is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for data exfiltration, combined with the execution of shell commands to gather system info and network details, and the lack of any legitimate application logic or user interaction, strongly indicates this code is designed for covert information theft and is malicious."
