      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command in setup.py that, upon package installation, automatically downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://filetransfer.io/data-package/MG85ggQt/download) and saves it to the user's LOCALAPPDATA directory as 'Driver.exe'. It then immediately executes this downloaded file using Windows shell execution without any user interaction, consent, or validation. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation. The use of a non-standard, hardcoded URL to fetch an executable, writing it to a system directory, and executing it silently during install is strongly indicative of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity and execution, which aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including remote payload retrieval, execution at install time, and lack of transparency or validation."
