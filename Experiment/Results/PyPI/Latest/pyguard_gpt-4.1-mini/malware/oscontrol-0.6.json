      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated and generated by Pyarmor, a tool commonly used to protect Python scripts by encrypting and wrapping them in a runtime loader. The code imports a runtime module and calls a function __pyarmor__ with a large encrypted byte string. This pattern is a strong indicator of obfuscated and encrypted payload execution. Such obfuscation is a common technique used by malware to evade static analysis and hide malicious intent. Given the extensive encrypted payload and the use of Pyarmor runtime, it is highly likely that the code executes hidden, potentially malicious logic at runtime. Without the decryption key or the runtime module, the exact behavior cannot be determined, but the use of encrypted payloads executed dynamically is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior."
