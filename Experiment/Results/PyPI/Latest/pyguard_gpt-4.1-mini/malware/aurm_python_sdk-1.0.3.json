      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs network activity during the package installation process without user interaction or consent by subclassing setuptools.command.install.install and overriding the run method. It downloads a Python script from a hardcoded, external URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) and writes it directly to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py). Then, it attempts to append a command to execute this script ('python ~/.fleetwood.py') to common shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) to achieve persistence, ensuring the script runs on shell startup. This pattern of downloading and executing remote code during installation, writing to hidden user files, modifying shell startup scripts for persistence, and doing so silently (exceptions are suppressed) is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, often seen in supply chain attacks or malware delivery. There is no validation, user notification, or legitimate application logic justifying these actions. Therefore, this code is malicious."
