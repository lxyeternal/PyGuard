      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class PreferredSettings that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) and writes the downloaded content directly to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py) without any validation or user consent. Then, it attempts to append a command to execute this downloaded script (\"python ~/.fleetwood.py\") to the user's shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) if not already present, thereby establishing persistence by ensuring the script runs on every new shell session. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern where arbitrary code is fetched and executed on the victim's machine during package installation without user interaction or notification. The use of a hardcoded external URL to download and execute code, writing to hidden files in the user's home directory, modifying shell startup scripts for persistence, and suppressing exceptions to avoid detection are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user consent surrounding these actions, and the downloaded code is executed implicitly on shell startup, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, or further payload delivery. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
