      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes a main() function from a module named 'main'. This behavior triggers code execution at install time without explicit user interaction or consent, which is a known supply chain attack vector and a hallmark of malicious packages. Although the provided snippet does not show the contents of the 'main' module, the pattern of executing arbitrary code during package installation is strongly associated with malware, as it can be used to deliver payloads, establish persistence, or perform unauthorized actions on the victim system. The presence of this dynamic import and execution in the install hook, combined with the lack of any user notification or validation, classifies this code as malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this sensitive system fingerprinting data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs without any user interaction or consent. The domains used (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun') are non-standard, suspicious, and likely attacker-controlled endpoints commonly used for out-of-band interaction or data exfiltration. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, indicating an attempt to evade detection. The combination of environment discovery, encoding of sensitive data, and exfiltration to hardcoded suspicious URLs is a hallmark of information-stealing malware or reconnaissance stage of an attack. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification justifying this behavior. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with data exfiltration and system fingerprinting malware."
