      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes an external executable file ('your_executable.exe') during the package installation process without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it triggers arbitrary code execution as a side effect of package installation, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The executable is run via subprocess.run immediately during setup, which can lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. There is no validation, user notification, or error handling around this execution, increasing the risk. Executing binaries during installation without explicit user consent is a critical risk pattern associated with malware."
