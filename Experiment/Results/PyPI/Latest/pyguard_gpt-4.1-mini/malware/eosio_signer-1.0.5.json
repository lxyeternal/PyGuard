      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It executes shell commands during package setup without user consent to collect system information (hostname, current user, network configuration) and appends environment variables (likely containing sensitive data such as private keys and metadata) to a temporary file. It then immediately exfiltrates this collected data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external IP address (http://61.28.229.27). This sequence of environment variable access, file writing, shell command execution, and network exfiltration during package installation is a classic pattern of information-stealing malware and supply chain attacks. The use of os.system to run commands that gather system info and the immediate upload of this data to an untrusted external server without any user interaction or legitimate application logic confirms malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. Specifically, in the EOSIOKey class constructor (__init__), it imports subprocess and requests modules and immediately executes system commands to gather sensitive system information: hostname, current user, and network interface configuration. These commands write their output to a temporary file '/tmp/r'. Then, the code performs an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://61.28.229.27), uploading the collected system information file without any user consent or notification. This sequence of environment discovery and immediate exfiltration of potentially sensitive host data to a suspicious, hardcoded external IP address is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware. The absence of any legitimate application logic or user interaction around this network activity, combined with the use of subprocess.getoutput to silently gather system details and the use of requests.post to exfiltrate data, strongly indicates malicious intent. The rest of the code implements cryptographic key handling and signing functionality, which appears benign and related to EOSIO blockchain keys, but the embedded data exfiltration behavior in the constructor is a critical risk indicator of malware."
