      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute a reverse shell payload during package installation. Specifically, it constructs a Python one-liner reverse shell command that attempts to connect back to a hardcoded IP address (172.19.132.154) on port 8867. This command duplicates the socket file descriptor to stdin, stdout, and stderr, disables shell history logging, and spawns a bash shell, effectively giving remote command execution control to the attacker. The reverse shell command is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed via os.system without any user interaction or consent. Embedding such a reverse shell in the install process is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution on any system that installs this package. The use of hardcoded IP and port, obfuscation via base64 encoding, execution during installation, and spawning of an interactive shell are all strong indicators of malicious intent."
