      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a lambda function that dynamically imports 'zlib' and 'base64' modules, then decodes a large base64-encoded string which is reversed, decompresses it using zlib, and immediately executes the resulting code with exec(). This pattern of reversing, base64 decoding, decompressing, and executing code is a classic and strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is used to obfuscate and hide the true payload from static analysis. The use of exec() on dynamically decoded and decompressed data allows arbitrary code execution, which can lead to downloading further malware, data exfiltration, or system compromise. There is no user interaction, no legitimate application logic, and the payload is fully concealed until runtime. According to the provided knowledge points, this pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior."
