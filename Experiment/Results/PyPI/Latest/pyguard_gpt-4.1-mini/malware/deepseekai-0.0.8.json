      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as the current user ID (via 'id' or 'whoami'), the system hostname, and an environment variable 'ENV'. It then silently sends this information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://eoyyiyqubj7mquj.m.pipedream.net) without any user interaction, consent, or notification. The use of a non-standard, obscure domain (pipedream.net endpoint) for data exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code suppresses all warnings and silently ignores any request exceptions, which is typical of malware trying to evade detection. There is no legitimate application logic or user-driven context surrounding this network activity. This pattern matches known malicious behaviors related to system fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers."
