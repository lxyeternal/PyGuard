      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools commands that execute a shell command during package installation, development setup, and egg info generation. This shell command fetches an access token from the Google Cloud metadata server for a specific service account without user consent, then immediately sends this token via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/48961bc9-ec95-4b8c-9e4b-45c14aa3e70a). This behavior constitutes unauthorized exfiltration of sensitive credentials (access tokens) to an attacker-controlled endpoint. The code triggers this exfiltration automatically during package installation or setup phases, without any user interaction or notification. The use of a hardcoded suspicious webhook URL, execution of shell commands in install hooks, and exfiltration of sensitive tokens are strong indicators of malicious intent consistent with supply chain attacks and credential theft. Therefore, this code is malicious."
