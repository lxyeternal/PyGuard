      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior because it takes a screenshot of the user's screen immediately after installation without explicit user consent and sends this screenshot to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive user information. The webhook URL is hardcoded and points to an external Discord endpoint, which is a non-standard and suspicious destination for such data. Additionally, the code executes this behavior as a side effect of package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess to install required packages dynamically during this process further indicates an attempt to ensure the malicious functionality can run without user intervention. These factors combined—automatic data capture, exfiltration to a hardcoded external endpoint, and execution during installation without user interaction—are strong indicators of malicious intent."
