      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including public IP address, hostname, home directory, current working directory, and current time, then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://35.170.187.220:8080/) without any user interaction or consent. This data exfiltration occurs automatically during the package installation process by subclassing setuptools.command.install.install and overriding the run method to call the data collection and transmission function. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: unsolicited collection and exfiltration of sensitive system information, use of a hardcoded suspicious IP address, execution of network communication during package installation (a known supply chain attack vector), and absence of legitimate application logic or user notification. The code does not perform any legitimate installation tasks related to the package functionality but instead performs covert data exfiltration, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior."
