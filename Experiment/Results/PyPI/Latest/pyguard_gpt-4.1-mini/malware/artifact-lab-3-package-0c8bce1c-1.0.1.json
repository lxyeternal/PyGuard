      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that subclasses setuptools install and develop commands to run a function named 'notmalfunc' immediately after installation or development installation. This function collects all environment variables from os.environ, encodes them as URL parameters, and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL 'https://29c2aa2421c8.ngrok.app' without any user interaction, consent, or notification. This behavior constitutes automated exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment data to an attacker-controlled server during package installation, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded ngrok domain (commonly used for tunneling and often associated with temporary or attacker-controlled endpoints) further raises suspicion. There is no legitimate application logic or user-driven action justifying this data transmission. The code triggers this exfiltration as a side effect of package installation, which is a known malicious pattern. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware embedded in a Python package installation process."
