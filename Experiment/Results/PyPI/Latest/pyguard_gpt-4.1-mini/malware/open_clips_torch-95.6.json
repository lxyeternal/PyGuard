      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install. During the installation process, it runs the standard install routine and then imports and calls a main() function from a local module named main. This pattern is sometimes used to trigger post-install actions. However, there is no evidence in this snippet of obfuscation, network communication, dynamic code execution, or other suspicious behavior. The install_requires dependencies (requests, psutil) are common libraries and do not indicate malicious intent by themselves. The code does not perform any network calls, file writes, shell command executions, or environment manipulations within the provided snippet. Without the content of the main module, it is not possible to fully exclude malicious behavior, but based solely on this setup.py code, it does not exhibit any of the typical malicious characteristics or high-risk patterns described. Therefore, this code is classified as benign."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding for the MAC addresses is a common obfuscation tactic to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard, suspicious, and likely attacker-controlled, indicating data exfiltration. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The overall pattern matches known malicious behaviors such as system fingerprinting and covert data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers. Therefore, this code is malicious."
