      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior because it executes network communication during the package installation process without user interaction or consent. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to run a post-install hook that collects system information (hostname and OS) and the public IP address, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55). This pattern of environment discovery combined with immediate data exfiltration to a suspicious, hardcoded external endpoint during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of a webhook.site URL, which is commonly used for testing or as a disposable endpoint, further suggests this is not legitimate application logic. There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic justifying this behavior, and it occurs automatically as a side effect of installing the package, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Therefore, this code is classified as malicious."
