      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command for a Python package that, upon installation, automatically collects system information including the machine hostname, operating system, and public IP address by querying an external service (https://httpbin.org/ip). It then constructs a URL with this sensitive system information embedded as query parameters and sends an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook-test.com/8caf20007640ce1a4d2843af7b479eb1). This behavior occurs silently during the package installation process without any user interaction or consent. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL to exfiltrate system-specific data during installation is a classic indicator of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attack patterns. The code lacks any legitimate application logic justifying this data exfiltration, does not provide user notification, and is embedded in the setup installation hook, which is a known vector for malware. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior by performing unauthorized data collection and exfiltration during package installation."
