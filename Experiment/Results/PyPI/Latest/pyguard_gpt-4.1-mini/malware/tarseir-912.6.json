      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes a main() function from a module named 'main'. This means arbitrary code execution occurs automatically upon package installation without user interaction or consent. Executing code during package installation is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. Although the code itself does not show obfuscation or network activity, the pattern of triggering code execution as a side effect of installation is a critical risk indicator for malware. This behavior can be abused to run arbitrary or malicious payloads on the victim's system during installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information such as hostname, username, and current working directory without user interaction or consent, then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). These domains are not standard or known legitimate services and are commonly associated with security testing or exfiltration endpoints. The code performs this network communication silently, with no user notification or legitimate application logic, indicating potential data exfiltration. The use of random query parameters and multiple external endpoints further suggests an attempt to evade detection or ensure data delivery. Although the code does not execute downloaded content or perform direct code execution, the unsolicited collection and transmission of system-identifying information to suspicious external servers is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance or information-stealing behavior."
