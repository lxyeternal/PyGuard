      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to perform additional actions during package installation. Specifically, it collects system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://192.198.82.14:3000/log) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic example of environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded IP address, lack of legitimate application logic surrounding the network activity, and execution of network communication as a side effect of package installation strongly indicate malicious intent. This pattern aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including exfiltration of sensitive system information to an external IP, execution of code during package installation, and use of hardcoded suspicious endpoints."
