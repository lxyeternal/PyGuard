      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/awsglueml) immediately upon execution and also during the package installation process via a custom install command. This behavior triggers network communication without user interaction or consent, embedded in the setup.py installation script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The domain 'pov.sh' is non-standard and unrelated to the package's purported purpose. The code lacks any legitimate application logic surrounding the network requests, no user notification or validation is present, and the requests are made silently. This pattern is strongly associated with malicious activity, as it enables remote code execution or data exfiltration during package installation, a critical risk indicator for malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."

The domain 'pov.sh' and the port 45111 are unusual and not associated with standard or trusted services. This pattern of silent network communication to a suspicious endpoint is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, potentially for data exfiltration, command-and-control communication, or remote payload retrieval. There is no error handling, logging, or explanation of the request purpose, increasing suspicion. According to the provided knowledge points, such hardcoded, suspicious URLs combined with unsolicited network activity and absence of legitimate logic are typical characteristics of malware."
