      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that executes during the package installation process (setup.py). It collects detailed system information including OS details (via uname or systeminfo), current working directory, local IP configuration, public IP (via curl to ifconfig.me), current user (whoami), and hostname. It then immediately sends all this sensitive system information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL, which is an external endpoint unrelated to any legitimate package functionality. This exfiltration of sensitive environment and system data without user consent or notification, triggered automatically during installation, is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL for data exfiltration, combined with the execution of shell commands to gather system info and the absence of any legitimate application logic justifying this behavior, strongly indicates this code is designed for covert data theft and is malicious."
