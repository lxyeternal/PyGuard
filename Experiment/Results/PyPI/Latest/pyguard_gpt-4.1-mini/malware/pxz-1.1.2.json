It then immediately sends this sensitive information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded IP address (http://10.0.2.15:8080), which is a suspicious and non-standard endpoint. This exfiltration of system data during package setup is a classic indicator of malicious behavior, especially as it occurs automatically during installation without user notification. The use of os.popen to run a curl command to obtain the public IP, combined with sending environment and system details externally, aligns with known malware patterns for system fingerprinting and data exfiltration. The code is embedded in the setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector to execute malicious code during package installation. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this behavior, no user consent, and no error handling that would indicate benign intent. Therefore, this code is malicious."
