      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that executes during the package installation process (setup.py). It collects detailed system information including OS details (via uname or systeminfo), current working directory, local IP configuration, public IP (via curl to ifconfig.me), current user (whoami), and hostname. It then sends all this sensitive environment and system data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. This exfiltration of system and user information without user consent or notification, triggered automatically during package installation, is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for data exfiltration, absence of any legitimate application logic around this network activity, and execution of shell commands during install without user interaction all align with known malicious patterns. Therefore, this code is malicious as it performs unauthorized data collection and exfiltration during package installation."
