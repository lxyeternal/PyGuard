      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (PostInstallCommand) that overrides the standard install process in setup.py. During installation, it attempts to run shell commands that fetch and execute a remote script from a hardcoded, obfuscated URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoneroOcean/xmrig_setup/master/setup_moneroocean_miner.sh). The URL is constructed via character code obfuscation, and the shell commands use subprocess.run with shell=True, suppressing all output and errors. This behavior triggers automatic download and execution of a potentially untrusted mining script during package installation without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscation, execution of remote code during install, suppression of errors, and lack of validation or user interaction are classic indicators of malicious behavior, consistent with supply chain attacks or cryptomining malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
