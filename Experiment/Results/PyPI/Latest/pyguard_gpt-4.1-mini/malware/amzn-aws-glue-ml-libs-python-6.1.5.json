      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-aws-glue-ml-libs-python) immediately upon execution and also during the package installation process via a custom install command subclass. This behavior triggers network communication without user interaction or consent, embedded in the package setup/install script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The domain pov.sh is not a standard or trusted Python package source, and the code does not include any legitimate application logic around the network calls. The use of a post-install hook to perform network communication is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables remote code execution or data exfiltration during package installation. There is no error handling, user notification, or validation of the remote response, increasing the risk of arbitrary code execution or payload delivery. These factors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior in Python packages."

This domain and port combination is not associated with any known legitimate service or application. The request is made without any user interaction or consent, and there is no surrounding legitimate application logic explaining this network activity. Such behavior is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it may be used for unauthorized data exfiltration, command-and-control communication, or remote payload retrieval. The use of a hardcoded, suspicious external URL for network communication aligns with multiple key risk indicators and typical malicious code characteristics outlined in the knowledge points."
