      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class PreferredSettings that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) and writes the downloaded content directly to a hidden file in the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py) without any validation or user consent. Then, it attempts to append a command to execute this downloaded Python script (\"python ~/.fleetwood.py\") to the user's shell startup files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) if not already present, thereby establishing persistence by ensuring the script runs on every new shell session. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern where arbitrary code is fetched and set to execute automatically upon user login or shell start, without transparency or user interaction. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which can hide failures or detection. The use of a hardcoded external URL to fetch and execute code during package installation, combined with writing to hidden files in the user's home directory and modifying shell startup scripts, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification justifying these actions. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with remote code execution and persistence mechanisms commonly used in malware and supply chain attacks."
