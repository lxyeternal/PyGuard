      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method. During the installation process, it executes a shell command ('ls') to list directory contents, collects system information including hostname, current working directory, and username, and then sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://192.198.82.14:3000/log) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk patterns associated with malware, including: execution of shell commands during package installation, collection of system fingerprinting data, and exfiltration of this data to a suspicious hardcoded IP address. The use of a hardcoded IP rather than a legitimate domain, absence of user notification or consent, and embedding this behavior in the install hook strongly indicate malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks or information-stealing malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
