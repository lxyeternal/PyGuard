      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior primarily because it abuses the Python package installation process to execute unauthorized commands and attempts data exfiltration. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command with CustomInstall, which runs exec_command() during package installation without user consent. The exec_command function collects system information by running the 'id' command and enumerating the directory tree of '/etc/', then encodes this data in base64. Although the send_put_request function is stubbed to raise the encoded data (likely to be replaced or modified in a real attack), the intent is clearly to send this sensitive system information externally. This pattern of executing shell commands and gathering sensitive system data during package installation, combined with encoding the data for transmission, matches multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including data exfiltration, unauthorized code execution during install, and stealthy environment fingerprinting. The absence of legitimate application logic, user interaction, or notification, and the embedding of this behavior in the install hook, strongly indicates a supply chain attack vector. Therefore, this code is malicious."
