      "malicious_behavior": "The code subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command with a custom class CrazyInstallStrat. In the run() method, after running the standard install process, it dynamically imports a main() function from a module named 'main' and immediately executes it during package installation. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution as a side effect of package installation without user interaction or consent, which is a known supply chain attack vector and a hallmark of malicious packages. Although the code itself does not show obfuscation or network activity, the dynamic import and execution of code during install is a critical risk pattern strongly associated with malware. This pattern enables attackers to execute arbitrary payloads on the victim system during installation, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information such as hostname, username, and current working directory without user interaction or consent, then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). These domains are not standard or known legitimate services and are commonly associated with security testing or exfiltration endpoints. The code performs this data exfiltration silently, with no user notification or legitimate application logic surrounding the network activity. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with unsolicited outbound network communication to suspicious domains is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or staging malware behavior. There is no obfuscation or code execution, but the presence of hardcoded suspicious URLs and exfiltration of system/user data without consent classifies this as malicious."
