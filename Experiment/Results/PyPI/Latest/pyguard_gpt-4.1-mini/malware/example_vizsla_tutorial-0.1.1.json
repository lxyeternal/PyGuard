      "malicious_behavior": "The code subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command and runs a subprocess call to execute a module named 'example-vizsla-tutorial.trace' immediately after installation. This behavior triggers code execution as a side effect of package installation without user interaction or consent, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess.call during installation to run arbitrary code is a high-risk pattern strongly associated with malware. Additionally, the package name and module name appear unusual and potentially obfuscated (e.g., 'example-vizsla-tutorial.trace'), which raises suspicion. There is no indication that the executed module is benign or part of a standard installation process. This pattern matches the critical risk indicator of arbitrary code execution during package installation, a hallmark of malicious packages designed to execute payloads stealthily during installation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system and environment information, including OS type, hostname, Python package metadata, system executable path, and import stack traces. It then sends this potentially sensitive information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL (https://webhook.site/traces) without any user interaction or consent. The use of webhook.site, a known service often used for testing or as a temporary endpoint, combined with the unsolicited exfiltration of environment and package data, strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern matches critical risk indicators for information-stealing malware that performs system fingerprinting and data exfiltration to an external server. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification justifying this behavior, and the code operates autonomously, which is typical of malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
