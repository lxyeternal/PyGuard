      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects the user's public IP address and detailed geolocation and device information via external API calls without explicit user consent. It then sends this potentially sensitive information, along with the user's input and AI-generated responses, to a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, effectively exfiltrating data to an external entity. The Telegram bot token and chat ID are hardcoded, indicating a fixed recipient for the data. Additionally, the code makes HTTP requests to hardcoded IP addresses (104.236.72.47) with suspicious endpoints, which are not standard or documented APIs, suggesting communication with potentially malicious or attacker-controlled servers. The headers include a suspicious 'Host' value that does not match the IP address, indicating possible evasion or misuse. There is no user interaction or consent before these network communications and data transmissions occur. The combination of unsolicited data collection, exfiltration to a hardcoded Telegram bot, and communication with suspicious external IPs without transparency or user control aligns with typical malicious behavior patterns, specifically data exfiltration and potential command-and-control communication."
