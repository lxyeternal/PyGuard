It then sends this sensitive token via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://oe6tx4gsvtokjaxyelfy6bjjnat1hr5g.oastify.com/log). This behavior constitutes unauthorized exfiltration of sensitive credentials. Furthermore, this token exfiltration is triggered automatically during the package installation process (in setup.py), which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded, non-standard external domain for data exfiltration, combined with the lack of user notification or legitimate application logic, strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including data exfiltration of sensitive tokens during package installation without user consent."

It then sends this token via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://oe6tx4gsvtokjaxyelfy6bjjnat1hr5g.oastify.com/log) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic example of credential theft and data exfiltration. The use of a hardcoded, non-standard external domain for sending sensitive tokens, combined with the lack of legitimate application logic or user notification, strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern matches known indicators of malware that exfiltrate sensitive credentials from cloud environments."
