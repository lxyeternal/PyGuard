      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes a main() function from a module named 'main'. This means arbitrary code execution occurs automatically upon package installation without user interaction or consent. This pattern is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The code triggers execution of potentially untrusted code during installation, which can lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. Although the code itself does not show obfuscation or network activity, the immediate execution of code on install time from an external module is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding before exfiltration is a known obfuscation technique to evade detection. The domains used are not standard or trusted and resemble those used in security testing or malicious data exfiltration. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, avoiding detection or error reporting. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with covert data exfiltration to suspicious external endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or staging malware behavior."
