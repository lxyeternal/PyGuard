      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes a main() function from a module named 'main' without any user interaction or consent. This pattern of executing arbitrary code at install time is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The dynamic import and execution embedded in the install hook can be used to run arbitrary or harmful code on the user's system during package installation, which is a critical risk indicator for malware. Although the provided snippet does not show the contents of the 'main' module, the installation hook's behavior alone is a strong red flag for malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, then encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic surrounding this network activity. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before transmission is a common tactic to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard, suspicious, and likely attacker-controlled. The code silently suppresses all exceptions during network communication, which is typical of malware trying to avoid detection. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with covert data exfiltration to hardcoded suspicious endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or staging malware. There is no benign justification for this behavior in typical applications."
