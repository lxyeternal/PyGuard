      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, platform details, IP addresses, and domain names without any user interaction or consent. It then immediately sends this collected data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/gsa), which is a suspicious and non-standard domain typically used for testing or potentially for data exfiltration. The immediate transmission of detailed system fingerprinting data to an external endpoint without user notification or legitimate application logic strongly indicates data exfiltration behavior. This pattern aligns with known malicious behaviors of information-stealing malware that profile the host environment and send the data to attacker-controlled servers. The absence of error handling or user consent, combined with the use of a hardcoded suspicious webhook URL, classifies this code as malicious."
