      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes the main() function from a module named 'main'. This means that arbitrary code in 'main.main()' will run automatically upon package installation without explicit user consent or interaction. This pattern of executing code at install time is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. Although the provided snippet itself does not show network activity or obfuscation, the dynamic import and execution of code during installation is a critical risk indicator for malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's system during package installation. This behavior aligns with the knowledge points describing malicious code that abuses the installation process for code execution, a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, then encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends all this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic surrounding this network activity. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the MAC addresses before transmission is a common tactic to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard, suspicious, and likely attacker-controlled. This pattern of environment discovery combined with data encoding and exfiltration to hardcoded external endpoints is a hallmark of information-stealing or staging malware. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to avoid detection. There is no benign justification for this behavior, and it matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including unsolicited collection and exfiltration of sensitive system information to suspicious external servers."
