      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in Base64 (a common obfuscation technique) and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names that do not correspond to any known legitimate service. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses and the silent suppression of exceptions further indicate an attempt to stealthily fingerprint the host system. The combination of environment discovery, data encoding, and exfiltration to suspicious external endpoints is a hallmark of information-stealing malware or reconnaissance code preparing for further malicious activity. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with data exfiltration and system fingerprinting."
