      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It executes shell commands during package setup without user consent to collect sensitive system information (hostname, current user, network configuration) and appends environment variables (BX_API_HOSTNAME, BX_PRIVATE_KEY, BX_API_METADATA) which likely contain sensitive data. It writes this combined information to a temporary file (/tmp/r) and immediately exfiltrates it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external IP address (http://61.28.229.27). This sequence of environment variable access, system information gathering, file writing, and network exfiltration during package installation is a classic pattern of data theft and supply chain attack. The use of os.system calls to run shell commands without validation or user interaction, combined with hardcoded external IP and immediate data transmission, confirms malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. Specifically, in the EOSIOKey class constructor (__init__), it imports subprocess and requests modules and immediately executes system commands to gather sensitive system information: hostname, current user, and network interface configuration. These commands write their output to a temporary file '/tmp/r'. Immediately after, the code sends this collected sensitive information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://61.28.229.27) without any user interaction, consent, or notification. This sequence of environment discovery and immediate data exfiltration to a suspicious, hardcoded IP address is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware. The behavior is not related to the legitimate cryptographic functionality of the class and is hidden inside a constructor, ensuring it runs whenever an EOSIOKey object is instantiated. This unsolicited collection and exfiltration of system information to an external server without user consent or legitimate purpose is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
