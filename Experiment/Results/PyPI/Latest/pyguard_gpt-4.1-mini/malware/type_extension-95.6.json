      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports and immediately executes a main() function from a module named 'main'. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution at install time without user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. Executing code during package installation is a known hallmark of malicious packages, especially when the executed code is not part of the setup script itself but imported dynamically. Although the provided snippet does not show the contents of the 'main' module, the pattern of executing code on install via a custom install command is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks. Additionally, the package declares dependencies on 'requests' and 'psutil', which are common libraries used in malware for network communication and system information gathering, further raising suspicion. Given these factors and the well-documented risks of arbitrary code execution during installation, this code should be considered malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding before exfiltration is a known obfuscation technique to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard and appear to be related to out-of-band (OAST) testing or potentially attacker-controlled infrastructure. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. This pattern of environment discovery combined with encoded data exfiltration to suspicious external endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or staging malware. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior."
