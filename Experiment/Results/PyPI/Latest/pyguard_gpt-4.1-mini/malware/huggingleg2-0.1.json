      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical indicator of malicious behavior. It executes a shell command during the package setup process without user interaction or consent. Specifically, it checks if the environment variable 'X' is not set to 'True', and if so, it runs a reverse shell command using /bin/bash to connect to a hardcoded external IP address (120.55.57.148) on port 8080. This command redirects input/output to establish a remote shell, enabling unauthorized remote control of the host system. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware, particularly remote access trojans (RATs) or reverse shell payloads, and is never observed in benign software. The execution of such a command in the setup script (setup.py) is a known supply chain attack vector, allowing attackers to gain control during package installation. The use of a hardcoded IP address, lack of user consent, absence of legitimate application logic around the network activity, and immediate spawning of a shell process confirm the malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command that opens an interactive bash shell and redirects its input and output over a TCP connection to a hardcoded external IP address (120.55.57.148) on port 8080. This is a classic reverse shell pattern, which allows an attacker to gain remote command execution on the victim machine without user interaction or consent. The use of os.system to spawn a shell with redirected stdin/stdout/stderr over a network socket is a hallmark of remote access trojans (RATs) or backdoors. The hardcoded IP and port, absence of any legitimate application logic, and immediate spawning of a shell process over the network confirm this is malicious behavior."
