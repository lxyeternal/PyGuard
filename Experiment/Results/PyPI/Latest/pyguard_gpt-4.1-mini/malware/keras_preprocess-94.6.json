      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method. In this overridden run method, after calling the original install.run(self), it dynamically imports a main() function from a module named 'main' and immediately executes it during the package installation process. This pattern of executing arbitrary code at install time without user interaction or consent is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The dynamic import and execution of main() during installation can be used to run arbitrary or harmful code on the user's system as part of the package installation, which is a critical risk indicator for malware. Additionally, the package name 'keras_preprocess' and other metadata appear generic or suspicious, and the install_requires includes 'requests' and 'psutil', which are often used in malware for network communication and system monitoring, respectively. Although the code snippet itself does not show the contents of the 'main' module or what main() does, the pattern of executing code during installation without explicit user consent or transparency is a hallmark of malicious packages and supply chain attacks."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs with unusual domain names (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of base64 encoding for the MAC addresses before exfiltration is a known obfuscation technique to evade detection. The domains used are non-standard, suspicious, and likely attacker-controlled, indicating command-and-control or data exfiltration infrastructure. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The overall pattern matches known malicious behaviors of system fingerprinting and covert data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers without user consent or notification."
