      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class CrazyInstallStrat that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it dynamically imports the 'm' function from a module named 'main' and immediately executes it without any user interaction or consent. This pattern of executing arbitrary code during package installation is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The dynamic import and execution in the install hook can be used to run arbitrary or harmful code on the user's system at install time, which is a critical risk indicator. Although the code snippet itself does not show the contents of 'main.m()', the installation hook's behavior alone is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables arbitrary code execution during package installation without user awareness or control."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in Base64 and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to three hardcoded, suspicious external URLs that are not standard or trusted domains. The URLs are obfuscated using Base64 encoding to hide their true destination. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses and the silent suppression of exceptions further indicate stealthy behavior. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with covert data exfiltration to hardcoded, suspicious endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing or staging malware. The absence of any benign context or legitimate use case, along with obfuscation and external communication, classifies this code as malicious."
