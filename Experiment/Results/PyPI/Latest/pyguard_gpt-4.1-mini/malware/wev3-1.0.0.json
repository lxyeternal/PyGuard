      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command, which is a known vector for executing code during package installation without user consent (supply chain attack vector). Inside the run() method, it conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes decrypted code using exec(). The decryption uses a hardcoded Fernet key and an encrypted payload, which is a strong indicator of obfuscation and hiding of malicious intent. The decrypted payload is executed immediately during installation, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. The obfuscated class and variable names, the use of encrypted payload, and execution during install time are all hallmarks of malware. Additionally, the setup metadata is nonsensical and likely intended to avoid detection. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including arbitrary code execution at install time, obfuscation, and use of external dependencies for malicious purposes."
