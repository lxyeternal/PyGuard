      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system and network information (IP address, geolocation, organization, device model, OS info) without user consent and sends it to a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID via Telegram's API. This constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration. The use of a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID for sending sensitive system information is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables remote monitoring or tracking of the infected system. The code runs this data collection and exfiltration in a background thread without user interaction or notification, increasing stealth. Although the code does not execute arbitrary commands or download further payloads, the unsolicited collection and transmission of potentially sensitive information to an external entity is a hallmark of information-stealing malware. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior related to covert data exfiltration."
