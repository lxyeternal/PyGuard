      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation command for a Python package using setuptools. It subclasses the standard install command to run additional code during installation. The additional code attempts to fetch build eggs for the package's install_requires dependencies and then imports a module named 'pyprettifier' and instantiates an EmojiConverter object. There is no evidence of network communication, code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, shell command execution, or any other suspicious or malicious behavior. The package name 'cryptograohy' appears to be a typo or a non-standard name but does not itself indicate malicious intent. The post-install action is limited to importing a dependency and creating an object, which is benign. No sensitive data is accessed or exfiltrated, no external URLs or IPs are contacted, and no code is executed dynamically or from untrusted sources. The code is consistent with a legitimate package setup pattern that extends installation behavior in a minimal and transparent way."
