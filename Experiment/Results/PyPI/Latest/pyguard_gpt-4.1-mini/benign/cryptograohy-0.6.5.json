      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class PostInstallCommand that runs during the package installation process. It attempts to install the 'pyprettifier' package via pip subprocess call and then imports it to instantiate an EmojiConverter object. The package name 'cryptograohy' appears to be a typo or a non-standard name, but this alone is not malicious. The subprocess call to pip install a dependency during installation is somewhat unusual but can be legitimate in some cases to ensure dependencies are present. There is no evidence of obfuscated code, network communication to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, dynamic code execution from untrusted sources, or other typical malicious patterns. The error handling writes exceptions to a temporary file '/tmp/a', which is not a typical malicious behavior but could be improved for robustness. Overall, the code does not exhibit any of the critical or high-risk malicious patterns described in the knowledge base. It appears to be a benign setup script with a post-install hook to ensure a dependency is installed and used."
