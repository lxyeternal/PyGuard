This network activity is embedded directly in the module's top-level code, which means it executes as soon as the module is imported or the package is installed. Additionally, the setup() call defines a package named 'evil-pkg2' with a suspicious name and description that attempts to appear harmless. The combination of immediate network communication to a suspicious endpoint during package setup or import is a known pattern associated with malicious behavior, such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or command-and-control communication. Although the URL is localhost, the use of a suspicious path '/evil' and the lack of any legitimate application logic or user consent strongly indicate malicious intent. This pattern aligns with critical risk indicators for supply chain attacks and unauthorized network communication embedded in package installation or initialization."
