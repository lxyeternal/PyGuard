      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external endpoint controlled by a third party. It sends a message containing a hardcoded URL to an audio file hosted on a third-party file hosting service (Catbox). This behavior is consistent with data exfiltration or unauthorized communication to an external server without user interaction or consent. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL for sending data externally is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it can be used to silently transmit information or signals to an attacker-controlled endpoint. Although the code does not perform direct code execution or file writing, the unsolicited network communication to a hardcoded external webhook URL without user consent or legitimate application logic is suspicious and aligns with known malicious patterns."
