      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom post-install command in a Python package setup script that runs after installation. It attempts to install the 'pyprettifier' package via pip (even though it is already listed in install_requires), imports it, uses an EmojiConverter class from it to convert a sample text, and writes the output to a temporary file. The use of os.system to run 'pip install pyprettifier' during post-install is somewhat unusual but not inherently malicious. There is no evidence of obfuscated code, network communication to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or execution of arbitrary or downloaded code. The code writes output to /tmp/emoji_output.txt and logs errors to /tmp/a, which are standard temporary locations. The package name 'cryptograohy' appears to be a typo but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code performs a benign post-install action related to formatting text with emojis and does not exhibit any known malicious patterns or behaviors."
