      "malicious_behavior": "The code searches the root directory ('/root') for files with the extension '.session' and then sends each found file to Telegram via the function send_file_to_telegram. This behavior matches a classic pattern of unauthorized data exfiltration: scanning sensitive system directories for session or credential files and transmitting them to an external endpoint without user consent or interaction. The use of a hardcoded sensitive path ('/root') and a specific file extension associated with session data strongly indicates intent to steal sensitive information. The code lacks any legitimate application logic or user notification, and the function names suggest covert data exfiltration. According to the provided knowledge points, unsolicited collection and transmission of potentially sensitive files to an external service (Telegram) without user consent is a critical indicator of malicious activity."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior because it enumerates files with a given extension recursively in a specified directory and sends these files to a hardcoded Telegram bot via the Telegram Bot API without any user interaction or consent. This pattern is a classic indicator of data exfiltration, where potentially sensitive files are collected and transmitted to an attacker-controlled external endpoint. The use of a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID for sending documents is suspicious and consistent with malware that uses Telegram as a covert channel for data theft. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity, and the code silently reads and uploads files, which aligns with typical malicious exfiltration behavior."
