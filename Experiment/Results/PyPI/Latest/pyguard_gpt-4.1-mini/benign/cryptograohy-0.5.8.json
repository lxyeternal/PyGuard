      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines a custom installation command for a Python package using setuptools. It overrides the install command to first ensure that the required dependencies (specifically 'pyprettifier') are installed before proceeding with the installation. The code imports 'pyprettifier' dynamically after installation and creates an instance of 'EmojiConverter' from that package. There is no evidence of network communication, code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or any suspicious file or system operations. The package name 'cryptograohy' appears to be a typo but does not itself indicate malicious intent. The error handling writes exceptions to a log file in /tmp, which is a common practice for debugging. Overall, the code follows a legitimate pattern for post-install actions in Python packages and does not exhibit any of the typical malicious behaviors or risk indicators outlined."
