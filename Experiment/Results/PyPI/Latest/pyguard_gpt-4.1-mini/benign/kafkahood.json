      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command for a Python package that attempts to download a YAML configuration file from a hardcoded URL and save it to a user-specific directory (~/.kafkahood/config.yaml). If the download or parsing fails, it falls back to a default configuration dictionary. The code then writes this configuration to disk before proceeding with the standard installation. The URL used is a legitimate AWS API Gateway endpoint, which could be part of the package's infrastructure. There is no evidence of code execution from downloaded content, no obfuscation, no shell command execution, no data exfiltration, and no suspicious environment or system information gathering. The network activity is limited to a single GET request to fetch configuration data, which is a common pattern in legitimate software. The code runs during installation but only to prepare configuration, not to execute arbitrary or remote code. Therefore, based on the provided knowledge points and analysis, this code does not exhibit malicious behavior."
