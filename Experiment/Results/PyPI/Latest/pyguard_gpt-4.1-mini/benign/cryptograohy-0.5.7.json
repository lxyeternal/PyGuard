      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class (PostInstallCommand) that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute additional code during package installation. Specifically, it runs a subprocess that executes a Python script located at 'cryptograohy/cli.py' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a known supply chain attack vector, where arbitrary code execution is triggered during package installation, potentially allowing malicious payloads to run on the victim's system. The package name 'cryptograohy' appears to be a typo-squatting variant of 'cryptography', which is a common tactic used by attackers to trick users into installing malicious packages. The post-install hook runs code silently and does not perform any validation or user notification, increasing the risk. Although the code itself does not show explicit network communication or obfuscation, the execution of an arbitrary script during installation without user consent is a critical risk pattern strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks."
