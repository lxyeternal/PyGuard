      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command in setup.py that executes shell commands during package installation without user interaction or consent. Specifically, it runs a pip install command to install an additional package ('pyprettifier') and then executes a file named 'colotama' located in the installation directory. This behavior enables arbitrary code execution at install time, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The execution of shell commands during installation, especially running an executable script from the installed package directory, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no validation, user notification, or error handling around these calls, increasing the risk. This pattern is strongly associated with malware that abuses the package installation process to execute unauthorized code on the victim's system."
