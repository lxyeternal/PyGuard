      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior. It dynamically imports modules using obfuscated strings ('impo' + 'rtli' + 'b.u' + 'til' and 'zipim' + 'port'), which is a common technique to evade static analysis. It also uses a metaclass to intercept object creation and execute potentially malicious code during import or instantiation. The function 'test' attempts to load and execute code from a ZIP file ('zip.zip'), which could be used to deliver a malicious payload. Additionally, the code manipulates builtins and sys.modules, which are high-risk behaviors often associated with malware trying to persist or evade detection. The combination of dynamic imports, metaclass manipulation, and ZIP file execution suggests this code is designed to inject or execute arbitrary code without user consent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by using a custom install class (CoInstall) with a metaclass (Metaclass) that is imported from an external file (meta.py). This setup allows arbitrary code execution during package installation, a common technique in supply chain attacks. The use of a metaclass and custom install hooks without clear, benign purpose suggests potential for malicious payload delivery or execution during installation. Additionally, the package includes non-standard resources (resources/*) without documented justification, raising further suspicion about its intent."
