      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior, including the use of obfuscated import statements (e.g., 'impo'+'rtli'+'b.u'+'til' and 'zipim'+'port') to evade detection. It dynamically loads and executes modules from a ZIP file ('zip.zip') without user consent or transparency. The code also employs a metaclass ('Metaclass') with an '__init__' method that triggers the 'test' function, which performs dynamic module loading and execution. These patterns are commonly found in malware to hide malicious payloads, execute arbitrary code, and evade static analysis. Additionally, the lack of clear, legitimate functionality and the use of obfuscation techniques strongly suggest malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code utilizes a custom install class `CoInstall` that inherits from `setuptools.command.install` and employs a metaclass `Metaclass` from an external module `meta`. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, enabling arbitrary code execution during package installation. The absence of any legitimate installation logic in the `CoInstall` class and the reliance on a metaclass for behavior modification strongly suggest malicious intent, likely for persistence, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment without user awareness."
