      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install command (CustomInstallCommand) that executes the function collect_data during package installation without user consent. This behavior is indicative of malicious activity, specifically a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically during the installation process. The collect_data function is likely designed to gather and exfiltrate system information, as suggested by the setup's description ('A Python package to collect and send system information.'). Additionally, the package includes the requests library as a dependency, which could be used for data exfiltration. The lack of user notification or consent for data collection and potential network communication further supports the classification of this code as malicious."
