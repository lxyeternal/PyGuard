Additionally, the setup.py script is a common vector for supply chain attacks, where malicious code can be executed during package installation. The lack of transparency regarding the package's functionality and the minimal classifier information raise further concerns."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes system-level commands to read the contents of a file named './flag' without any user interaction or validation. Accessing files with names like 'flag' is often indicative of attempts to read sensitive or privileged information, possibly from challenge environments (e.g., CTF competitions), production systems, or unauthorized access to system files. This behavior aligns with typical malicious activities such as credential theft, unauthorized data access, and potential privilege escalation."
