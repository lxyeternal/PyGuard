Specifically, it writes a file '/tmp/seasides2025_pypi_poc.txt' with a predefined message. This is done via a custom PostInstallCommand class that overrides the standard setuptools install command to include unauthorized actions. This pattern is indicative of supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation without the user's knowledge, potentially leading to further malicious activities such as data exfiltration or system compromise."
