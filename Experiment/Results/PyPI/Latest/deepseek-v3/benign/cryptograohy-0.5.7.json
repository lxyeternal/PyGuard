      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom PostInstallCommand class that executes a CLI script (cli.py) during package installation without user consent. This behavior is typical of supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed automatically upon installation. The script's execution is hidden behind a try-except block, which suppresses errors and attempts to obscure the malicious activity. Additionally, the package name 'cryptograohy' appears to be a potential typo-squatting attempt of 'cryptography', a popular Python library, further indicating malicious intent. The lack of transparency about what the CLI script does poses a significant security risk."
