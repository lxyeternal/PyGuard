      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several indicators of malicious behavior. It manipulates the builtins to dynamically import modules (importlib.util and zipimport) indirectly, which is a common evasion technique used in malware to bypass static analysis. The test function loads and executes a module from a zip file (zip.zip) without explicit user interaction or consent, suggesting arbitrary code execution. Additionally, the use of a metaclass to hijack initialization (Metaclass.__init__) raises red flags as it can be used to execute code upon instantiation without clear, legitimate purpose. The overall pattern of dynamic imports, execution of code from compressed archives, and metaclass tampering is strongly associated with malware tactics aimed at evading detection and executing unauthorized payloads."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class (MeInstall) that uses a metaclass (Metaclass) imported from an external module (meta.py). This pattern is highly suspicious as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation, a common technique in supply chain attacks. The use of a metaclass in this context suggests potential dynamic behavior or code injection, which could be used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration or remote code execution. Additionally, the inclusion of package_data (resources) without clear documentation or legitimate purpose further raises concerns about hidden malicious payloads. The combination of these elements indicates a strong likelihood of malicious intent."
