      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior by leveraging setuptools installation hooks to execute arbitrary code during package installation. Specifically, it defines a custom install class 'N' that overrides the run method to call a function 'test()' before proceeding with the normal installation. The 'test()' function dynamically imports and executes code from a ZIP archive ('zip.zip') using zipimport and importlib.util. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation without user consent. The pattern of executing code during installation from an external or obfuscated source is a hallmark of malware, as it enables remote code execution and potential system compromise."
