      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several indicators of malicious behavior. It uses dynamic imports and string concatenation to obfuscate the import statements (e.g., 'impo' + 'rtli' + 'b.u' + 'til' and 'zipim' + 'port'), which is a common technique to evade static analysis. The code also accesses __builtins__ in an unconventional way, which is often used in malicious code to bypass security controls. The test function dynamically loads and executes code from a zip file ('zip.zip'), which can be used to deliver and execute arbitrary malicious payloads. Additionally, the Metaclass is defined with __init__ set to the test function, suggesting malicious code execution during object initialization. These behaviors are consistent with malware that aims to evade detection and execute unauthorized code."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains suspicious behavior indicative of potential malicious intent. It defines a custom install class (MeInstall) that inherits from setuptools.command.install and uses a metaclass (Metaclass), which is unusual and could be used to inject malicious behavior during package installation. The lack of transparency about the purpose of the Metaclass and the custom install hook raises concerns about unauthorized code execution during installation, a common tactic in supply chain attacks. Additionally, the setup configuration includes an unusual cmdclass setup that could be used to execute arbitrary code."
