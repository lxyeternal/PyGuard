      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior. It includes a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID for sending collected data to a Telegram bot controlled by the attacker. The code gathers sensitive information such as IP address, city, region, country, location, organization, postal code, timezone, device model, and operating system information without user consent. It then exfiltrates this data to the attacker's Telegram bot. The use of threading to silently collect and send data in the background, and the presence of a misleading message ('This script is outdated, please download the latest version.') suggest an attempt to deceive users while performing unauthorized data collection and exfiltration."
