      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by executing custom code during package installation through a custom install class (class N). This is a common tactic in supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed automatically upon installation. The test() function dynamically loads and executes a module from 'zip.zip' without proper validation or user consent. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. The presence of zipimport and dynamic module loading (importlib.util) without clear, benign purpose is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the package setup uses a misleading name ('code-beautifyer') which could be an attempt at typosquatting to trick users into installing malicious software."
