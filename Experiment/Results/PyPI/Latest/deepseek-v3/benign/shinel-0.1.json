      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom PostInstallCommand class that executes an external script (install.sh) during package installation. This behavior is suspicious because: 1) It runs arbitrary shell commands during installation without user consent, 2) It modifies file permissions (chmod) to make the script executable, 3) The script execution is not transparent about its purpose, 4) Package installation hooks are commonly abused in supply chain attacks to run malicious code automatically. This pattern matches known malicious behavior where packages use installation hooks to execute unauthorized commands."
