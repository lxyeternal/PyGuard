      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom PostInstallCommand class that executes during package installation. This class attempts to write to a file (/tmp/a) upon installation, which is a suspicious behavior. While the action itself (writing a simple string to a file) isn't extremely harmful, the pattern of executing custom code during installation (especially in setup.py) is commonly abused in supply chain attacks. The package name 'cryptograohy' appears to be a typosquatting attempt (misspelling 'cryptography'), which is another red flag for potentially malicious intent. The combination of these factors suggests malicious behavior."
