      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior. It makes HTTP requests to hardcoded IP addresses (104.236.72.47) with suspicious endpoints (/spider_XR, /devils_gpt, /worm_gpt). These endpoints suggest potential involvement in malicious activities such as data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. Additionally, the code includes a Telegram channel reference (t.me/spider_XR) in the response, which is a common tactic used by malicious actors for coordination or distribution of malicious payloads. The use of generic exception handling and minimal error messages ('An unexpected error occurred. Try again. It will be fixed') further obscures potential malicious activities. The code does not perform any legitimate or documented functionalities, and its operations align with known malicious patterns."
