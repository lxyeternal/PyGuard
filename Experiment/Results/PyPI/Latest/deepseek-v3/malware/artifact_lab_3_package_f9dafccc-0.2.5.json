This behavior is indicative of credential theft and unauthorized data exfiltration, as it involves accessing sensitive authentication tokens and transmitting them to a potentially attacker-controlled endpoint without user consent. The use of hardcoded remote URLs and direct token exfiltration during package installation are strong indicators of malicious intent."
