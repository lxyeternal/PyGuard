      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom command `custom_command()` that attempts to access Google Cloud metadata to retrieve an access token from a specific service account and then exfiltrates this token to an external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/c3913969-ff17-4757-a267-069d41c248a7). This is a clear attempt to steal credentials and is indicative of malicious intent. Furthermore, the malicious command is executed during package installation, development, and egg_info phases by overriding standard setuptools commands (CustomInstallCommand, CustomDevelopCommand, CustomEggInfoCommand). This behavior is consistent with supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during standard package management operations without user consent or awareness."
