      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes an imported 'main' function immediately upon installation. This behavior is highly suspicious as it triggers arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. Additionally, the package requires 'requests' and 'psutil', which are often used in malicious code for network communication and system monitoring. The lack of transparency about what the 'main' function does further exacerbates the risk."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several indicators of malicious behavior, including the collection of sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses), encoding this data (base64), and exfiltrating it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external domains without user consent or notification. The use of subprocess calls to gather system-specific data (MAC addresses) and the silent transmission of this data to attacker-controlled servers via HTTP requests are classic hallmarks of information-stealing malware. The domains in the URLs list appear to be randomly generated or use subdomains associated with malicious activity (e.g., 'oast.fun', 'byted-dast.com'), which are common in malware for data exfiltration. The code also suppresses all errors (broad try/except blocks), further hiding its malicious activities from detection."
