      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several malicious behaviors: it collects sensitive system information (including hostname, current working directory, IP configuration, and public IP) during package installation without user consent. It then exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL (https://hooks.slack.com/services/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) via a curl command. This behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware, as it gathers and transmits system data to an attacker-controlled endpoint. The use of a custom install hook in setup.py to execute this code during package installation is a common technique in supply chain attacks."
