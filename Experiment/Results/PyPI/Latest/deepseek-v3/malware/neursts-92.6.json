      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that is executed during package installation. This class imports and runs a function 'main' from a module 'main' without any user interaction or consent. The setup includes dependencies 'requests' and 'psutil', which could be used for network communication and system monitoring. This pattern is characteristic of supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation, potentially enabling arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment without user awareness. The behavior is consistent with malicious activity observed in other Python malware samples."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses) and transmits this data encoded in base64 to multiple hardcoded external URLs without user consent or notification. The domains used (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun') appear suspicious and are indicative of attacker-controlled infrastructure commonly used in data exfiltration. The absence of user notification, lack of legitimate purpose for collecting this data, use of encoding (base64), and communication with multiple suspicious domains are strong indicators of malicious intent, classifying this as information-stealing malware."
