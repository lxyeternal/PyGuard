      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class (PreferredSettings) that executes during package installation. This class downloads a file from a remote URL (fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) and writes it to the user's home directory as ~/.fleetwood.py. It then attempts to modify the user's shell configuration files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile) to automatically execute this downloaded script upon shell startup. This behavior constitutes a backdoor installation as it downloads and executes arbitrary code without user consent, modifies system configurations for persistence, and operates silently (suppressing all exceptions). These actions are typical of malicious supply chain attacks aiming to establish persistence and remote code execution capabilities."
