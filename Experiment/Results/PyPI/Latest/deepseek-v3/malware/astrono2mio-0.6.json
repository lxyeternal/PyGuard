      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior. It uses obfuscation techniques such as base64 encoding and decoding to hide its true intent. The code dynamically decrypts and executes a payload during the installation process, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks. It also checks for the presence of a debugger and exits if one is detected, which is a technique used to evade analysis. The code is designed to run only on Windows, suggesting targeted malicious activity. Additionally, it imports and uses cryptographic libraries (AES, ChaCha20) to decrypt and execute a hidden payload, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of a custom install class to execute malicious code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks."
