      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it makes an HTTP request to a potentially attacker-controlled domain (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/ver) during both the script execution and post-installation phase. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack where malicious code is executed automatically during package installation without user consent. The use of a custom PostInstallCommand to run post-install logic that includes network communication is a strong indicator of malicious intent, commonly associated with data exfiltration, remote code execution, or further malware deployment."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a potentially suspicious URL ('http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/awsgluedq'). This behavior is indicative of potential data exfiltration or communication with a command and control (C2) server. The use of a non-standard port (45111) and a domain that does not appear to be a legitimate service further increases suspicion. There is no user interaction or consent for this network operation, which aligns with typical malicious behavior."
