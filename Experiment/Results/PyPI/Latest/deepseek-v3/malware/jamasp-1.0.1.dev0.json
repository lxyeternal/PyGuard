      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating sensitive system information (hostname, current working directory, and username) to a hardcoded remote server (http://192.198.82.14:3000/log) during package installation. This is achieved by overriding the setuptools install command to include custom code that collects and sends this data without user consent. Such behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware and constitutes a supply chain attack."
