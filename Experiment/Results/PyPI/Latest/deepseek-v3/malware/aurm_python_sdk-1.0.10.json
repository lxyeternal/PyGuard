      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom install class 'PreferredSettings' that downloads a file from a remote URL during installation. The downloaded file is saved to the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py) and then executed by appending a command to run this file to shell configuration files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile). This behavior is highly suspicious as it: 1) Downloads and executes remote code without user consent, 2) Attempts to achieve persistence by modifying shell configuration files, 3) Uses broad exception handling to suppress errors and continue execution silently, and 4) Performs these actions automatically during package installation. These characteristics are consistent with supply chain attacks and malicious package behavior."
