      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior. It decodes base64-encoded URLs (base_ssl_cert and base_ssl_key) which are then used to make an HTTP POST request to an external server. The decoded base_ssl_cert appears to be a URL (http://154.42.3.233:443/api/callback), which is likely an attacker-controlled server. The function ssl_config() reads a local file specified by the decoded base_ssl_key (config.yml) and sends its contents to the decoded URL without user consent. This behavior is characteristic of data exfiltration, where sensitive configuration data is transmitted to a remote server controlled by an attacker. The use of base64 encoding for URLs and file paths is a common obfuscation technique to evade detection."

It decodes a base64-encoded URL (base_ssl_cert) which resolves to 'http://154.42.3.233:443/api/callback', a suspicious IP address. It then attempts to read a configuration file specified by another base64-encoded string (base_ssl_key, which decodes to 'config.yml') and sends its contents to the aforementioned IP address via an HTTP POST request. This behavior is consistent with data exfiltration to a potentially attacker-controlled server. The use of base64 encoding to obscure the destination URL and file path, along with the lack of user consent or legitimate context for this network communication, strongly suggests malicious intent."
