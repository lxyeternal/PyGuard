      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation hook 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes arbitrary code during package installation without user consent. This behavior is characteristic of supply chain attacks where malicious code is injected into package installation processes. The hook imports and executes the 'main' function from a module named 'main', potentially performing unauthorized actions such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or system compromise. Additionally, the package requires 'requests' and 'psutil', which are commonly used in malicious code for network communication and system monitoring respectively."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) and encodes it (base64). It then attempts to exfiltrate this data to multiple hardcoded suspicious URLs (including domains like 'oast.fun' and 'byted-dast.com', which are associated with command and control servers). The code suppresses all errors with broad try/except blocks, indicating it's designed to operate stealthily. This behavior matches classic information-stealing malware patterns: unauthorized data collection, encoding for exfiltration, and communication with attacker-controlled infrastructure."
