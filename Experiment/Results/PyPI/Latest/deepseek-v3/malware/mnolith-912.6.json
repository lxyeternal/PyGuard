      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by defining a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that overrides the standard setuptools install process to execute arbitrary code during package installation. Specifically, it imports and runs a function named 'main' from a module 'main' during the installation process, which is a common technique used in supply chain attacks to execute malicious payloads without user consent. The setup configuration includes a dependency on 'requests', which could be used for network communication or data exfiltration. This pattern is consistent with malware that leverages package installation hooks for unauthorized code execution, data collection, or further compromise of the host system."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) without user consent and attempts to exfiltrate this data to multiple hardcoded suspicious URLs (e.g., 'http://dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com'). The use of random numbers in the URL path and lack of transparency about data usage are strong indicators of malicious intent. This behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware or reconnaissance for further attacks."
