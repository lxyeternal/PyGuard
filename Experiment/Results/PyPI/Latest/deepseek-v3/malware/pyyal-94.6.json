      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes an external 'main' function during package installation. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, as it allows arbitrary code execution during the installation process without user awareness. The setup includes dependencies ('requests', 'psutil') that could be used for network communication or data exfiltration. The package lacks transparency about its functionality, and the custom install hook is designed purely to run code immediately upon installation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, then encodes the MAC addresses in base64. It then sends this information to multiple hardcoded suspicious URLs via HTTP GET requests without any user consent or notification. This behavior is indicative of information-stealing malware, designed to exfiltrate system data to attacker-controlled servers. The presence of multiple hardcoded exfiltration endpoints, combined with silent data collection and transmission, strongly suggests malicious intent."
