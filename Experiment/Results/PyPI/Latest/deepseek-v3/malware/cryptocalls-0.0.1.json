It downloads an executable file (CBLines.exe) from a GitHub repository using PowerShell and executes it without user consent. The use of subprocess to run PowerShell commands for downloading and executing files is a common technique in malware. Additionally, the code lacks transparency about the purpose of the downloaded executable, and there is no user notification or consent mechanism. These actions are consistent with malware that aims to download and execute arbitrary payloads on a victim's system."

This behavior is characteristic of malware, as it involves downloading and running an executable without user consent or knowledge. The use of PowerShell commands to download and execute the file is a common technique in malicious scripts to evade detection. Additionally, the lack of transparency regarding the purpose of the executable and the absence of user interaction or validation further indicate malicious intent."
