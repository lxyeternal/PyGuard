      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes code from 'main.py' during package installation without user consent. This pattern is commonly used in supply chain attacks to execute arbitrary code automatically when the package is installed, potentially leading to unauthorized actions such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or further malware deployment. The use of installation hooks for code execution is a strong indicator of malicious intent, especially when combined with obfuscated or unclear package descriptions and dependencies like 'requests' and 'psutil' which could be used for malicious purposes."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several malicious behaviors: it collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses), encodes this information using base64, and exfiltrates it to multiple hardcoded suspicious URLs via HTTP GET requests. The URLs (e.g., 'dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com') appear to be attacker-controlled domains, likely used for command and control (C2) or data exfiltration. The code also suppresses all exceptions to avoid detection and uses randomization to generate unique identifiers for the exfiltration requests. These behaviors are characteristic of information-stealing malware or reconnaissance tools that harvest system data for malicious purposes."
