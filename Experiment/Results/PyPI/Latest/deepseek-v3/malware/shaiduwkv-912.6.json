      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes an external function 'main' from a module 'main' during package installation. This behavior is suspicious as it allows arbitrary code execution during installation without user knowledge or consent, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The setup also includes 'requests' as a dependency, which could be used for network communication (potential data exfiltration). The lack of transparency and legitimate purpose for executing external code during installation strongly indicates malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and exfiltrates it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external domains (byted-dast.com, oast.fun) without user consent. These domains appear to be attacker-controlled (common in malware for exfiltration). The use of random numbers in URLs and multiple fallback domains suggests an attempt to evade detection. The behavior matches typical information-stealing malware patterns, where data is collected and sent to remote servers for malicious purposes."
