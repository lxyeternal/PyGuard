This behavior is indicative of a downloader or dropper malware, which is commonly used to fetch and execute additional malicious payloads. The executable is run with the -NoNewWindow and -Wait flags to hide its execution from the user, a tactic often used by malware to avoid detection. The combination of downloading an executable from an external source and executing it without user consent or notification is a strong indicator of malicious intent."

This behavior is typical of malware, as it involves downloading and running an executable from an external source without user consent. The fact that the executable is run silently (with '-NoNewWindow -Wait') further suggests malicious intent, as it attempts to hide its execution from the user. Additionally, the code lacks any user notification or consent mechanisms for downloading and executing the file, which is a strong indicator of malicious behavior."
