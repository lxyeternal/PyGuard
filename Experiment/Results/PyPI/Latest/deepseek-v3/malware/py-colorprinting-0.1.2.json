      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a zip file from a remote URL ('https://cosmoplanets.net/well-known/pki-validation/ore-miner.zip') without user consent, extracts it, and executes an executable ('ore-miner.exe') from the extracted files. This behavior is characteristic of malware, specifically a dropper or downloader that fetches and executes additional malicious payloads. The use of tempfile and subprocess with hidden window flags (creationflags) indicates an attempt to execute the payload stealthily. Additionally, the broad exception handling (empty except blocks) suggests the code is designed to suppress errors and continue execution silently, which is common in malicious software to evade detection."
