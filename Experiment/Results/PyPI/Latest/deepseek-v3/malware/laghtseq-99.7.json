      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes a function 'main' from a module 'main' during package installation. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation without user consent. The setup function includes 'requests' as a requirement, suggesting potential network communication for data exfiltration or payload download. The lack of transparency regarding the purpose of the 'main' function and its execution during installation raises significant security concerns."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and exfiltrates it to suspicious external domains via HTTP requests. The domains (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun') appear to be attacker-controlled, as they resemble domains used for command and control (C2) or data exfiltration in malware. The code uses urllib to silently transmit the data without user consent, typical of information-stealing malware. The random number appended to the URL suggests an attempt to evade simple signature-based detection."
