      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install command that downloads and executes an external executable (putty.exe) from a remote URL during package installation without user consent. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically during package installation. The downloaded file is saved with a misleading name ('ins42.exe') and immediately executed using os.system, which can lead to remote code execution and potential system compromise. Such actions are typical of malware attempting to gain persistence or deliver additional payloads."
