      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' which executes code from an imported 'main' module during the package installation process. This behavior is characteristic of supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation without user awareness. The lack of transparency about what 'main.main()' does and the execution during installation suggests potential for arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. The presence of 'requests' in install_requires also indicates potential network communication capabilities, which could be used for malicious purposes like data exfiltration or downloading additional payloads."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and exfiltrates it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious URLs without user consent. The URLs appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., 'oast.fun', 'byted-dast.com'), which are commonly used in malicious activities for data exfiltration. The code also uses randomization (random.randint) for URL paths and suppresses errors with generic exception handling, which are techniques often employed by malware to evade detection. The combination of system information gathering, unsolicited network communication to external domains, and lack of user notification or consent strongly indicates malicious intent."
