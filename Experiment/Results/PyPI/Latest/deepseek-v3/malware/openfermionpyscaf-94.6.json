      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom setuptools installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes code from a module 'main' during package installation. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation without user consent. The use of installation hooks to execute arbitrary code is a common technique in malicious packages. Additionally, the code imports and uses 'requests' and 'psutil', which could be used for data exfiltration or system surveillance. The lack of transparency and user notification regarding the execution of 'main.main()' further supports the classification of this code as malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses of the system. It then encodes this information using base64 and sends it to several hardcoded external URLs via HTTP requests. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration, a common malicious activity where sensitive data is sent to an attacker-controlled server without the user's consent. The code also attempts to obfuscate its actions by using base64 encoding and suppressing any exceptions that might occur during the HTTP requests. Furthermore, the URLs used for communication are suspicious and appear to be dynamically generated or attacker-controlled domains (e.g., 'oast.fun'), which are commonly used in malicious activities. The absence of any legitimate purpose for collecting and transmitting such data reinforces the classification of this code as malicious."
