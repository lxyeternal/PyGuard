This behavior is typical of malware, as it involves downloading and running an external executable file silently, which could lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. The use of subprocess.run to execute PowerShell commands for downloading and running the file further indicates malicious intent, as it bypasses user interaction and potentially security controls."

This behavior is indicative of a dropper or malware installer, as it involves downloading and running an unknown executable without user consent. The use of PowerShell to download and execute the file in a hidden manner further suggests malicious intent, as it aims to evade detection. The source URL (GitHub repository) could be controlled by an attacker to distribute malicious payloads."
