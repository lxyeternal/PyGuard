      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes an unknown main() function from a module 'main' during package installation. This behavior is characteristic of supply chain attacks, where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation without user consent. The setup requires 'requests' and 'psutil', which could be used for data exfiltration and system monitoring. The package metadata (name, author, description) is vague ('anon', 'fantasia3d'), lacking transparency. The use of a custom install hook to trigger arbitrary code execution is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables unauthorized actions on the victim's system."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) and transmits it to multiple hardcoded external URLs (oast-cn.byted-dast.com, i18n.oast-row.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) without user consent. This behavior is indicative of information-stealing malware. The use of base64 encoding for MAC addresses and the suppression of all exceptions (try-except with pass) further suggests attempts to obfuscate and evade detection. The domains in the URLs appear to be associated with ByteDance's DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) platforms, commonly used for security testing, but in this context, they are being used for unauthorized data exfiltration."
