      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class (CustomInstall) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During installation, it sends an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL (https://py.chain2.eyes.sh/) without any user notification or consent. This behavior is indicative of potential data exfiltration or a call to an attacker-controlled server, which is a common characteristic of malicious packages. Additionally, the commented-out code suggests the package was intended to collect sensitive system information (hostname, current working directory, username) and exfiltrate it, reinforcing the malicious intent."
