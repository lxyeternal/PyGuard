      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes a function 'main' from a module 'main' during package installation. This behavior is suspicious as it runs arbitrary code during installation without user consent. Additionally, the package requires 'requests' and 'psutil', which are often used in malicious code for network communication and system monitoring. The setup.py does not have legitimate package setup logic but instead focuses on executing code during installation, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This pattern is commonly associated with supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) and exfiltrates this data encoded in base64 to multiple hardcoded external URLs via HTTP requests. The domains in the URLs ('oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'i18n.oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun') appear suspicious and resemble domains used for command and control (C2) or data exfiltration in malware. The code suppresses all errors to avoid detection and runs without user consent. This behavior aligns with typical malware patterns such as system reconnaissance and unauthorized data exfiltration."
