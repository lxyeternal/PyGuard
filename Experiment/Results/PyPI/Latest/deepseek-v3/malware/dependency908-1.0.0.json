      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating sensitive system information (hostname, current working directory, and username) to an external server without user consent. This is done through a custom install class (CustomInstall) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. The malicious behavior is triggered during package installation, which is a common technique in supply chain attacks. The code uses the requests library to send the collected data to a hardcoded, attacker-controlled domain (http://gj8fxybp.requestrepo.com), indicating a clear intent to gather and exfiltrate sensitive information."
