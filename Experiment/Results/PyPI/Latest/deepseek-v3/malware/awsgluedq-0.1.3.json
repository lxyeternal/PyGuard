This behavior is indicative of malicious activity as it involves unsolicited network communication to a remote server without user consent or legitimate purpose. Such actions are commonly associated with data exfiltration, remote code execution, or checking into a command-and-control (C2) server, which aligns with typical characteristics of malware."

This behavior is indicative of potential data exfiltration or communication with a command-and-control (C2) server, which are common characteristics of malicious software. The lack of context or legitimate purpose for this network communication further supports the classification as malicious."
