      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior. Firstly, it collects sensitive system information such as the operating system details, current working directory, network configuration, and public IP address without user consent. Secondly, it exfiltrates this collected data to an external Slack webhook (https://hooks.slack.com/services/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) during the package installation process. This behavior is concealed within a custom installation class (CustomInstall), which is a common technique for executing malicious code during package setup. Additionally, the code lacks any legitimate functionality related to the package's purported purpose ('python-drgn-commons-metrics'), further indicating its malicious intent. The combination of unauthorized data collection and exfiltration to a remote endpoint during installation is a hallmark of malicious supply chain attacks."
