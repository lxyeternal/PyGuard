      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function 'push_secrets' that reads AWS credentials from the user's home directory (~/.aws/credentials) and sends them to a hardcoded webhook URL ('https://eo64g38fdes1lxm.m.pipedream.net'). This behavior is malicious as it involves unauthorized exfiltration of sensitive credentials without user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for data exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent, commonly associated with credential theft and information-stealing malware."
