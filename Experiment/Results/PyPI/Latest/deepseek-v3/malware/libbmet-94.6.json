      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes arbitrary code from 'main.py' during package installation. This is a common technique used in supply chain attacks to execute malicious payloads automatically when a package is installed. The behavior is suspicious due to the lack of transparent functionality during installation, which typically should not execute arbitrary code. Additionally, the setup requires 'requests' and 'psutil', which are often used in malicious scripts for network communication and system information gathering, respectively."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, current working directory, and MAC addresses (encoded in base64). It then attempts to exfiltrate this data to three hardcoded, suspicious URLs (e.g., 'http://dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com'). The URLs appear to be dynamically generated and resemble domains used in command and control (C2) infrastructure for data exfiltration. The code suppresses all errors and runs silently without user consent, which is typical behavior for information-stealing malware. The combination of system information gathering, encoding, and unsolicited network communication poses a severe threat to confidentiality, privacy, and system integrity."
