It downloads an executable file (zwerve.exe) from a GitHub repository without user consent or notification.\n2. The executable is run silently using PowerShell with the '-NoNewWindow' flag, which hides the window from the user.\n3. The behavior matches common malware delivery techniques where the malicious payload is downloaded and executed without user interaction.\n4. The use of subprocess to run PowerShell commands to download and execute files is typical of malware trying to evade detection by running commands indirectly.\n5. There is no legitimate reason provided for downloading and executing an unknown executable from a remote source."

This behavior is characteristic of malware, as it involves downloading and running potentially harmful executable files from external sources. The use of PowerShell to download and execute files further increases the risk, as it can bypass certain security measures. The absence of any user notification or consent for these actions is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
