This action is performed within a custom install command (CustomInstallCommand) that extends the standard setuptools install command. The behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed when a package is installed, potentially leading to remote code execution, system compromise, or further malware deployment. The use of requests to download the file and subprocess.Popen to execute it, combined with the lack of user notification or consent, confirms the malicious intent."
