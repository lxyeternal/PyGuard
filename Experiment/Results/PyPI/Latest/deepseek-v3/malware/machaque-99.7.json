      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that inherits from setuptools.command.install and overrides the run method to execute code from 'main.py' during package installation. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation without user awareness or consent. The presence of a custom install hook with network communication capabilities (as implied by the 'requests' requirement) is a hallmark of malware, enabling unauthorized operations such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, and persistence."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and exfiltrates it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs without user consent. The use of random numbers in the URL path and the lack of legitimate purpose for this data collection indicate malicious intent. The URLs appear to be attacker-controlled (e.g., 'oast.fun' domains are commonly used for malicious out-of-band testing). This behavior aligns with information-stealing malware that gathers reconnaissance data to send to command-and-control servers."
