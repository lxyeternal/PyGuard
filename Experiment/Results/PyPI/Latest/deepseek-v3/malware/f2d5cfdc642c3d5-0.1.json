      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom install class (`CustomInstall`) that executes a function (`exec_command`) during package installation without user consent. This function collects system information (current user ID and directory tree of `/etc/`), encodes it in base64, and sends it to a hardcoded external domain (`blackwolf.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com`) via an HTTP PUT request. The domain appears to be an attacker-controlled endpoint for data exfiltration. The combination of unauthorized data collection, encoding, and transmission to an external server during installation is a hallmark of malicious supply chain attacks. Additionally, the code lacks transparency about its data collection and transmission activities, further reinforcing its malicious intent."
