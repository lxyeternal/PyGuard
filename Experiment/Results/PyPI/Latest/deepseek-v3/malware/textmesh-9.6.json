      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes imported functions during installation (via 'main()'). This pattern is commonly observed in malicious packages where unauthorized code execution is embedded within legitimate installation hooks. The requirement of packages like 'requests' and 'psutil' further suggests potential network exfiltration or system monitoring capabilities. The setup intentionally lacks transparency regarding the purpose of the automatic execution, and the author information is obscured ('anon', placeholder email). Together, these characteristics indicate a supply chain attack vector where arbitrary code can be executed on the victim's machine during package installation without consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) and exfiltrates it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious URLs. The data is encoded using base64 prior to transmission. The code attempts to contact multiple external domains, which appear to be attacker-controlled (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun'). The combination of system reconnaissance, data encoding, and unsolicited network communication to external endpoints is a hallmark of information-stealing malware. This behavior is performed without user consent or notification."
