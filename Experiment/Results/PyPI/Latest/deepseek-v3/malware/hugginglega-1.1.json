      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior by attempting to download and execute a script from a remote IP address (192.3.209.43) using curl and pipe to sh. This is a classic example of a remote code execution (RCE) attack, where arbitrary code is fetched from an external server and executed on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of os.system to execute the command further confirms the malicious intent, as it bypasses any security checks or user prompts. Additionally, the presence of a hardcoded IP address and the lack of any legitimate package functionality (only checking for the 'transformers' library as a decoy) strongly indicate that this code is designed to deploy malicious payloads."
