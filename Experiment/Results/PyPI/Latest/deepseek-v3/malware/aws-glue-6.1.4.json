This behavior is indicative of a potential data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication, which is typical in malicious code. The setup.py file is being used to execute network operations during package installation, a common technique in supply chain attacks to establish covert communication with attacker-controlled servers."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code snippet performs an HTTP GET request to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/aws-glue' without any apparent legitimate purpose or user consent. This behavior is indicative of potential malicious activity, specifically data exfiltration attempts to a suspicious domain (pov.sh). The following factors contribute to this classification:\n1. Unnecessary network request during runtime\n2. Hardcoded suspicious URL (non-standard port 45111 with '/api/v3/aws-glue' path)\n3. No legitimate functionality provided by the request\n4. No error handling or validation\n5. Potentially communicates with Command and Control (C2) infrastructure\nThe combination of unsolicited network communication with a potentially rogue domain raises strong suspicions of malicious intent, particularly for reconnaissance or data exfiltration purposes."
