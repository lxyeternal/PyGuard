      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that imports and runs a function 'main' from 'main.py' during package installation. This behavior is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during installation without user consent, which is a common technique in supply chain attacks. The presence of this setup, especially with vague descriptions ('x' for author, description, etc.), minimal setup logic, and the use of installation hooks for code execution, strongly suggests malicious intent. Additionally, the package requires 'requests', which could be used for downloading or exfiltrating data."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and attempts to exfiltrate this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious domains ('dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oqvignkp58-psl.i18n.oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'sbfwstspuutiarcjzptfenn9u0dsxhjlu.oast.fun') via HTTP requests. The domains appear to be attacker-controlled (using DNS tunneling or callback services like Interactsh or Burp Collaborator). Additionally, the hardcoded endpoints ('/realtime_p/pypi/[random_number]') suggest a Command-and-Control (C2) infrastructure. The code lacks user consent or legitimate purpose for data collection and transmission, and the use of random numbers for URLs indicates potential evasion techniques. This behavior is consistent with information-stealing malware or reconnaissance payloads."
