      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes code from 'main.main()' during package installation. This is a common technique for malicious code execution in supply chain attacks. The behavior is suspicious because legitimate packages typically do not execute arbitrary code during installation unless necessary for setup purposes (e.g., compiling extensions). Additionally, the inclusion of 'requests' as a requirement suggests potential network communication capabilities, which could be used for data exfiltration or downloading additional payloads. The lack of transparency about what 'main.main()' does further increases suspicion."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and attempts to exfiltrate this data to multiple hardcoded suspicious URLs. The URLs appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun'), which are commonly used for malicious command and control (C2) or data exfiltration. The code does not provide any user notification or consent for this data collection and transmission. This behavior matches multiple indicators of malicious activity, including: unauthorized collection of system/user information; transmission to hardcoded attacker-controlled domains; no legitimate purpose for sending host information to remote servers; and use of domains associated with malicious activity (oast.fun domains are commonly used in penetration testing and malicious payloads)."
