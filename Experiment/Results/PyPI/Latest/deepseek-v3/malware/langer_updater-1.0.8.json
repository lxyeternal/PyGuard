      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class (LangInstall) that executes arbitrary code during the package installation process (via the test() function). This function imports and executes code from a ZIP file ('my.zip') without user consent or transparency. The execution of arbitrary code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, allowing attackers to execute malicious payloads, perform data exfiltration, or gain unauthorized access to the system. The presence of dynamic code execution (zipimport, importlib) in an installation script is highly suspicious and not typical of legitimate package setup."
