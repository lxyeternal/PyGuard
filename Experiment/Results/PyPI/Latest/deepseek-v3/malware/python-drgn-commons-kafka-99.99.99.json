This data is then transmitted via HTTP POST to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. The behavior matches known malicious patterns such as unauthorized data collection, exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints, and abuse of installation hooks for malicious purposes. The code also uses system commands (ifconfig, ipconfig, curl, etc.) to gather sensitive information, further confirming its malicious intent."
