      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that overrides the standard setuptools install behavior to execute arbitrary code during package installation. This is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation without user awareness. The code imports and runs a 'main' function from 'main.py' immediately after installation, which could perform unauthorized actions such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or further malware deployment. The use of installation hooks (setuptools cmdclass) and immediate execution upon install without user consent strongly indicates malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple indicators of malicious behavior: 1. Collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) without user consent. 2. Sends this information to multiple hardcoded and suspicious external URLs (including domains like 'oast.fun' and 'byted-dast.com' which appear to be attacker-controlled domains). 3. Uses randomized URLs with query parameters to evade detection (the random number in the path). 4. No legitimate purpose is evident for this data collection and transmission. 5. The code attempts to hide its network communication errors by catching all exceptions broadly. 6. The domains in the 'urls' list appear randomly generated and resemble domains used in malicious command-and-control infrastructure."
