      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class that executes encrypted and obfuscated Python code during package installation on Windows systems. The encrypted payload is decrypted using a hardcoded Fernet key and executed via the `exec` function, which can allow arbitrary code execution. The setup.py file includes non-descriptive metadata and author information, and the install hook imports the `requests` library, suggesting potential network exfiltration or communication with a remote server. This behavior is characteristic of a supply chain attack aimed at executing malicious code during package installation."
