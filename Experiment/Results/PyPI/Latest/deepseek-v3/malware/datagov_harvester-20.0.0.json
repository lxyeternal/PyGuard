      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by automatically initializing a SystemCollector upon import and collecting/sending data whenever an undefined attribute is accessed (via __getattr__) or when the module's directory is queried (via __dir__). This behavior is indicative of stealthy data collection without user consent. The lack of transparency about what data is collected, how it is used, and where it is sent, combined with the automatic execution of data collection hooks, strongly suggests malicious intent. This pattern is consistent with information-stealing malware that operates covertly during normal Python operations."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system and network information (hostname, IP addresses, domains, platform details, UUID, and installation path) without user consent or notification. It then exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded webhook URL (https://webhook.site/gsa) using HTTP POST requests. This behavior is indicative of information-stealing malware, as it gathers reconnaissance data and transmits it to a potentially attacker-controlled endpoint. The combination of system data collection, hardcoded exfiltration URL, and lack of user consent aligns with typical malicious patterns."
