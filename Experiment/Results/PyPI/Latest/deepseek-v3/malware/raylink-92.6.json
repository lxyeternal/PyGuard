      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes arbitrary code (from main import main) during package installation without user knowledge or consent. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, enabling arbitrary code execution when the package is installed. The behavior is consistent with malware that leverages setuptools install hooks for persistence and remote code execution."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple characteristics of malicious behavior: 1) It collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) without user consent. 2) It encodes the collected data (base64 encoding of MAC addresses). 3) It attempts to exfiltrate this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious domains (e.g., *.oast*.com, *.oast.fun) which appear to be attacker-controlled infrastructure (common in DNS exfiltration scenarios). 4) The code suppresses all errors and continues execution silently. 5) The domains used (with 'byted-dast' in them) suggest this may be associated with ByteDance-related security tests or data collection, but without proper disclosure or consent mechanism. 6) The combination of system reconnaissance (MAC addresses can uniquely identify devices) with covert data exfiltration is a hallmark of information-stealing malware."
