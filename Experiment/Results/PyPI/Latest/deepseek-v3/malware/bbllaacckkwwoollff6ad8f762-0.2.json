      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior: 1. It defines a custom install class (CustomInstall) that executes arbitrary code during package installation via exec_command(). 2. It communicates with a hardcoded external domain (blackwolf.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com) without user consent, which is suspicious and indicative of data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication. 3. The exec_command() function conditionally executes downloaded code (via exec(body)) if the current username is 'modelarts', demonstrating targeted malicious behavior. 4. The code includes functionality to collect system information (get_current_username) and send it to a remote server (send_put_request), which is a hallmark of information-stealing malware. 5. The overall behavior is consistent with a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically during package installation. These characteristics are typical malware techniques and strongly indicate malicious intent."
