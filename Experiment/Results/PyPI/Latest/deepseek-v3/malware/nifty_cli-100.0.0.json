      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It includes a hardcoded encoded webhook URL (ENCODED_WEBHOOK) which is decoded using a Caesar cipher (decode_url function). During package installation (via CustomInstallCommand), it triggers a canary token URL (trigger_canary) that collects the host user information (get_host_user) and sends it to an external server via HTTP GET request (requests.get). This behavior is hidden within the package installation process, and there is no user consent or notification for this data collection and transmission. Additionally, the setup.py file primarily focuses on executing this data exfiltration logic rather than performing legitimate package installation tasks, which is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack."
