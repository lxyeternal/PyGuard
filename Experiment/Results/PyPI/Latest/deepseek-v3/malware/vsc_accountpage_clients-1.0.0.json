      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior. It uses a custom install class during package installation to collect sensitive system information (hostname, current working directory, username) without user consent. This data is then exfiltrated to an external server (burpcollaborator.net, which is commonly used for testing exfiltration in security research) via HTTP requests. The combination of system information gathering, unsolicited network communication, and execution during installation is a hallmark of information-stealing malware and supply chain attacks. Additionally, the code lacks transparency or user notification about this data collection and transmission, further indicating malicious intent."
