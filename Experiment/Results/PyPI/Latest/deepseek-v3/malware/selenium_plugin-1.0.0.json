The command runs a Python script that imports and executes a function from 'autostart.py' without user consent or transparency. This behavior is characteristic of malicious packages that execute arbitrary code during installation, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The lack of clear documentation or user notification about this post-install activity further raises suspicion."

These actions collectively indicate an attempt to establish persistent unauthorized access and execute potentially malicious payloads."
