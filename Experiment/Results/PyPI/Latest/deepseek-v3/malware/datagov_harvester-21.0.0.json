      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits potentially malicious behavior by automatically collecting and sending data without user consent or notification. The `SystemCollector` initialized upon import suggests background data collection. The `__getattr__` and `__dir__` hooks ensure that any attribute access or directory listing operation triggers data collection and transmission, which is a hallmark of stealthy data exfiltration. This behavior aligns with typical malicious patterns of unauthorized data collection and transmission without user awareness."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information (hostname, IP addresses, domains, platform details, installation path) and sends it to a hardcoded webhook URL (https://webhook.site/gsa) without user consent or notification. This behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware, as it exfiltrates sensitive data to an attacker-controlled endpoint. The use of system calls (socket.gethostname, socket.gethostbyname, socket.getaddrinfo) and network requests (requests.post) for unauthorized data collection and transmission aligns with malicious intent."
