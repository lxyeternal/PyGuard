      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior. It writes a base64-encoded payload to a file and executes it using the system's Python interpreter. The payload is obfuscated and dynamically executed, which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection. The code also attempts to clean up by removing the file after execution, which is indicative of an attempt to hide its activities. The use of base64 encoding and dynamic execution (via system calls) are hallmarks of malicious payload delivery and execution."
