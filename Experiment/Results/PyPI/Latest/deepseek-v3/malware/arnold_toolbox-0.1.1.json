This behavior qualifies as a dependency confusion attack, where the package setup includes unauthorized network communication to an attacker-controlled domain, potentially leading to remote code execution."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a request to an external domain (oastify.com), which is commonly used for testing purposes but can also be indicative of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or beaconing to a command and control server. Additionally, the commented-out code suggests an intention to send system information to a Discord webhook, which is a known technique for exfiltrating data in malicious scripts. The presence of remote code execution (RCE) mentioned in the comments further supports the classification of this code as malicious."
