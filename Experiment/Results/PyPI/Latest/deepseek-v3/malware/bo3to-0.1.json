It defines a custom install class 'gpl' that overrides the standard install process. The class includes obfuscated code (variable 'l') that is decoded and written to the .profile file of users with UID 1000 (typically the first normal user on Unix-like systems). This action could lead to arbitrary code execution upon user login, compromising the system. The code accesses sensitive system files (/etc/passwd) without user consent and modifies user profiles in a hidden manner, which is a clear indicator of malicious intent."
