      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes arbitrary code from an imported 'main' module during package installation. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, as it allows for unauthorized code execution during installation without user consent. The pattern of using setuptools install hooks to trigger malicious code execution is a known malicious technique, enabling potential remote code execution, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. Additionally, the package requires 'requests', which is often used in malicious code for network communication and data exfiltration."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and sends it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious URLs without user consent. This behavior is characteristic of data exfiltration malware, as it transmits identifiable user and system data to potentially attacker-controlled endpoints. The URLs resemble command-and-control (C2) or exfiltration domains (e.g., 'oast.fun' and 'byted-dast.com'), which are commonly associated with malicious activity. Additionally, the use of randomization (random.randint) in the URL path is a tactic to evade detection. The absence of user notification or consent for this data collection and transmission further confirms the malicious intent."
