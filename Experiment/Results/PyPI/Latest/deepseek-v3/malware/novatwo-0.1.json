      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and encrypted payload execution. It uses the `requests` module to fetch an external resource (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sandraajvab/a/refs/heads/main/x.txt) which is then base64-decoded and decrypted using `nacl.secret.SecretBox` before being executed with `exec`. This behavior indicates dynamic code execution from a remote source, a hallmark of malware attempting to evade static analysis and deliver malicious payloads during runtime. The legitimate package setup logic appears to be a facade for malicious activity, as the malicious payload is executed during import time (via the inline exec statement) rather than during legitimate package installation or usage."
