      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes a function 'main' from a 'main' module during package installation. This behavior is characteristic of malicious code that executes arbitrary code during installation without user consent. The setup includes dependencies 'requests' and 'psutil', which are commonly used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration and system monitoring. The combination of a custom install command with unnecessary dependencies and hidden functionality strongly indicates malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several malicious behaviors: 1) It collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses). 2) It encodes the collected MAC addresses in base64 for obfuscation. 3) It sends this information to multiple hardcoded suspicious domains (e.g., 'dnipqouebm-psl.cn...', 'oqvignkp58-psl.i18n...') via HTTP requests. 4) The domains appear to be attacker-controlled (DNS loggers or callback domains from services like Burp Collaborator). 5) It suppresses all errors during the exfiltration attempts. 6) The random number generation and URL construction suggest evasion techniques. 7) No user consent or notification is given for this data collection and transmission. This behavior is consistent with information-stealing malware that exfiltrates system fingerprints to attacker-controlled infrastructure."
