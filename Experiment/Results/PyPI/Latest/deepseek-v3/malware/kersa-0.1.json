      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom PostInstallCommand class that extends the setuptools install command. During the installation process, it attempts to execute a series of obfuscated commands. The code uses lambda functions to construct strings from ASCII values, which are then used to form a URL and commands. Specifically, it tries to execute a bash command that downloads a script from a GitHub repository (get_url()) and runs it with a hardcoded token (t()). The use of obfuscation, dynamic command construction, and execution of remote scripts during package installation are clear signs of a supply chain attack. This behavior is designed to download and execute arbitrary code from a remote server without the user's knowledge or consent, which is a hallmark of malicious activity."
