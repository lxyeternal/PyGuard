      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple indicators of malicious behavior, including searching for and compressing folders named 'Telegram Desktop', excluding specific directories and files, and uploading the compressed data to a remote server (http://77.91.76.45:100/OPEN). The code also attempts to bypass detection by excluding certain user data directories and standard Telegram executable files. The use of hardcoded IP addresses for data exfiltration, combined with the automated collection and transmission of potentially sensitive data without user consent, strongly suggests malicious intent aimed at unauthorized data collection and exfiltration."
