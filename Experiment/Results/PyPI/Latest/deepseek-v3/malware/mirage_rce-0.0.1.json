It hardcodes an IP address (124.221.70.199) and port (8876) for the reverse shell connection. The reverse shell is encoded in base64 and executed via bash, allowing the attacker to gain remote control of the system where the package is installed. This behavior is characteristic of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is triggered during the installation of seemingly legitimate packages."
