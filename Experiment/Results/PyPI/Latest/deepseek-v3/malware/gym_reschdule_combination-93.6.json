      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes code from 'main.py' during package installation without user consent. This behavior is characteristic of supply chain attacks, where malicious code is executed automatically during package installation. The presence of this installation hook combined with the dynamic execution of code during setup indicates a malicious intent to perform unauthorized actions during installation, such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. The inclusion of 'requests' and 'psutil' in install_requires suggests potential for network communication and system monitoring, further supporting the malicious classification."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) without user consent, encodes it using base64, and exfiltrates this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs. The use of random URLs and dynamic data collection, combined with unsolicited network communication to attacker-controlled domains, is a hallmark of information-stealing malware. The broad try-except blocks suppress errors, hiding the malicious activity. The pattern of gathering system fingerprints and transmitting them to external servers is consistent with credential theft, remote access trojans, or initial reconnaissance for further attacks."
