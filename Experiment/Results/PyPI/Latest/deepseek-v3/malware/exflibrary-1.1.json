      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains suspicious indicators of malicious intent in its setup.py file. The description explicitly states 'Library for malware building, educational purposes only', which is atypical for legitimate packages. While it does not directly exhibit classic malicious behaviors like obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or immediate data exfiltration, labeling itself as a 'malware building' library raises significant concerns about its intent. Additionally, the package's author and email (rusty128944@gmail.com) do not appear linked to reputable projects, and GitHub repositories like 'exflibrary' may serve questionable purposes. Although no actual malicious actions are coded within the setup.py, the intent and labeling strongly suggest that the package is intended for malicious purposes or education on malware development, which could be misused."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several indicators of malicious behavior: 1) It downloads an external script from a hardcoded URL ('https://blockatlaspro.com/test.py') without user consent, 2) It writes the downloaded script to a hidden directory (~/AppData/Local/App) and marks it as hidden using SetFileAttributesW, 3) It executes the downloaded script in a new process with output suppressed, which is a common technique for malware to hide its activity, 4) The execution is triggered automatically if a specific file (settings.py) exists, without any user interaction or consent, 5) The combination of downloading, hiding, and executing remote code is a strong indicator of a dropper or loader malware pattern. These behaviors collectively demonstrate an intention to download and execute potentially malicious code while evading detection."
