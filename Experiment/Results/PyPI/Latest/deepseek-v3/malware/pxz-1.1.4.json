This behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware, as it exfiltrates data to an attacker-controlled endpoint. The code executes this data collection and exfiltration during package installation, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks. Additionally, the code lacks transparency regarding data collection and transmission, and there is no user notification or consent mechanism for these actions."
