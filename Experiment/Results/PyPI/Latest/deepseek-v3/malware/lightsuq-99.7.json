      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes code from 'main.py' during package installation without user consent. This behavior is typical of supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation. The presence of network-related dependencies ('requests') suggests potential data exfiltration or remote code fetching capabilities, though the actual malicious payload would be in 'main.py'. The package setup lacks transparency regarding the purpose of the install hook execution, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and exfiltrating this data to multiple hardcoded suspicious domains without user consent. The domains (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun') appear to be associated with malware command and control infrastructure, as indicated by their structure and TLDs (.cn, .fun). The code uses standard library modules (platform, getpass, os) for information gathering and urllib for network communication, which are common in information-stealing malware. Additionally, the code lacks any legitimate purpose for this data collection and transmission, further confirming its malicious intent."
