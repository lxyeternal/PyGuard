      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install command (PostInstallCommand) that executes an embedded '.exe' file during package installation. This behavior is typical of malicious code, as it allows arbitrary code execution without user consent. The use of subprocess.run to execute the binary is a strong indicator of malicious intent, potentially enabling remote code execution, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. Such patterns are commonly associated with supply chain attacks in Python ecosystems."
