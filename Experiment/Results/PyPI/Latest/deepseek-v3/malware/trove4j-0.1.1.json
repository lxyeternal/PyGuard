      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior: 1) It uses base64 encoding to obfuscate a URL, which is a common technique to hide malicious endpoints. 2) It collects the hostname of the system without user consent. 3) It establishes a network connection to an external server (constructed from the decoded URL) and sends the hostname as a query parameter, indicating potential data exfiltration. 4) It disables SSL certificate verification (ssl._create_unverified_context()), which is a security risk and often used in malware to bypass certificate checks. The combination of hostname collection, URL obfuscation, and unauthorized network communication strongly suggests malicious intent, likely for data exfiltration or establishing a command and control channel."
