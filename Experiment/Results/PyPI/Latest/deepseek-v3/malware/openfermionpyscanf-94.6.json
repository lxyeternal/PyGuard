      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes an unknown function 'main' from 'main' module during package installation. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation without user awareness. The execution of arbitrary code during installation with dependencies like 'requests' and 'psutil' suggests potential for data exfiltration or system reconnaissance. There is no legitimate reason for a package to execute code during installation in this manner, making this behavior highly suspicious and indicative of malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) and sends this data to multiple hardcoded external URLs without user consent. This behavior is indicative of information-stealing malware. The collected data is base64-encoded before transmission, which is a common obfuscation technique used in malicious code to evade detection. The URLs in the code ('dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oqvignkp58-psl.i18n.oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'sbfwstspuutiarcjzptf3c0cvb6yng6mw.oast.fun') appear to be attacker-controlled domains used for data exfiltration. The code suppresses any errors during the transmission attempts, further hiding its malicious activity. This pattern of unauthorized data collection and transmission is a hallmark of malware."
