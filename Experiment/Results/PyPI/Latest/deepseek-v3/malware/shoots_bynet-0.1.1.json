      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior: 1. It uses base64 encoding to obfuscate a URL, which is decoded and used to make a network request. This is a common technique to hide malicious endpoints from static analysis. 2. It collects the hostname of the system and sends it as part of the request to an external server without user consent. 3. The SSL certificate verification is disabled (ssl._create_unverified_context()), which could allow for man-in-the-middle attacks and makes the connection less secure. 4. The URL is constructed in a way that suggests it is intentionally hidden (split into two parts and encoded in base64), which is a tactic to evade detection. 5. The code does not provide any user notification or consent for data collection and transmission, which is typical of malicious software."
