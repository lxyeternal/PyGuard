      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by executing arbitrary code during the package installation process without user consent. Specifically, it defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that overrides the standard 'install.run' method to import and execute a 'main' function from 'main' module immediately after installation. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation, potentially leading to unauthorized actions such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or further malware deployment. The inclusion of 'requests' and 'psutil' in 'install_requires' suggests potential network communication and system information gathering capabilities, further supporting the malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, then encodes part of this data (MAC addresses) in base64. It then attempts to exfiltrate this data to several hardcoded URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., 'dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oqvignkp58-psl.i18n.oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'sbfwstspuutiarcjzptf0rueg2x53eh2c.oast.fun'), which are typical of domains used in command and control (C2) or data exfiltration in malware. The code suppresses all exceptions during the exfiltration attempts, indicating an attempt to hide its malicious activity. The combination of sensitive data collection encoding, and transmission to external domains without user consent is a hallmark of information-stealing malware."
