      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.run call that executes 'curl' to contact a webhook.site URL. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration or a call to a command-and-control server, typical of malicious activity. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL (https://webhook.site/c33c9bd8-baf5-4abd-b3d2-525a1e8dcc2c) is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it suggests the code is designed to communicate with an external server without user consent. This pattern is commonly observed in malware for credential theft, unauthorized data exfiltration, and potential account compromise."
