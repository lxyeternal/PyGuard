      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that is executed during package installation. This class imports and runs a function 'main' from a module named 'main'. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed during the installation process without user consent. The use of setuptools' install hooks to execute arbitrary code is a common technique in malicious packages to achieve persistence or perform unauthorized actions. The absence of any legitimate setup logic or transparent purpose further supports the classification of this code as malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and exfiltrates it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs. These URLs appear to be attacker-controlled or command and control (C2) servers (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun'). The data is transmitted via HTTP GET requests with parameters encoded in the URL. This behavior is indicative of information-stealing malware or reconnaissance activity commonly seen in malicious code. The lack of user consent, hidden data collection, and exfiltration to questionable domains are strong indicators of malicious intent."
