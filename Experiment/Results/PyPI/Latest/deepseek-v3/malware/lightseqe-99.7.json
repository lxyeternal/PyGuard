      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' which executes code from 'main.main()' during package installation without user consent. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically during package installation, potentially leading to unauthorized code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The use of installation hooks for arbitrary code execution is a common malicious technique and is not observed in benign package setups."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system and user information (hostname, username, current working directory) and transmits it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs without user consent. The URLs (e.g., 'http://dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com001', 'http://sbfwstspuutiarcjzptf0rueg2x53eh2c.oast.fun') appear to be dynamically generated or obfuscated, which is a common tactic in malicious code to evade detection. The transmission of collected data to multiple endpoints without any legitimate purpose or notification is a clear indicator of data exfiltration behavior, characteristic of information-stealing malware."
