      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior. It uses base64 encoding to obfuscate a Python script that is then compiled and executed dynamically. The decoded script includes operations to download and execute arbitrary code from a remote server (specified as 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/inject/DaTDTcxiSvq9OA6r'). Additionally, the script writes its payload to a temporary file and attempts to execute it using system commands. This pattern of dynamic code execution, remote payload fetching, and execution without user consent is characteristic of malware, specifically designed for remote code execution and potential system compromise."
