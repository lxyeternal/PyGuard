      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute a function 'main' from a file 'main.py' during package installation. This behavior is characteristic of supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during installation without user awareness. The setup function includes dependencies 'requests' and 'psutil', which could be used for network communication and system information gathering, respectively. The execution of arbitrary code as part of the installation process (via the 'cmdclass' parameter) is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables remote code execution, data exfiltration, and further malware deployment. The pattern observed is exclusively associated with malware and has no observed benign use cases."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple characteristics of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, then encodes this data using base64. This information is then exfiltrated to multiple hardcoded URLs (some of which appear to be typosquatted or suspicious domains) via HTTP requests. The code uses broad exception handling to silently fail if the exfiltration attempts are blocked, a common evasion technique. Additionally, the domains are hardcoded with no user consent or notification, and the code structure aligns with known information-stealing malware patterns. The combination of system information gathering, encoding, and exfiltration to external domains is a clear indicator of malicious intent."
