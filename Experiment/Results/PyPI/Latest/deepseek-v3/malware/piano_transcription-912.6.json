      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes a function 'main' from a module 'main' during package installation. This behavior is highly suspicious as it allows arbitrary code execution during installation without user consent or awareness. The setup configuration includes 'requests' as a requirement, which could be used for network communication or data exfiltration. This pattern is indicative of a supply chain attack where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation, potentially enabling remote code execution, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and exfiltrates it to external, hardcoded URLs without user consent or notification. The URLs appear to be attacker-controlled domains ('oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun'). These domains are associated with out-of-band application security testing (OAST) infrastructure, often used for malicious purposes such as command-and-control (C2) communication or data exfiltration. Additionally, the data is transmitted via HTTP (not encrypted), posing privacy and security risks. The random number generation (rd_num) could be an attempt to bypass simple detection mechanisms. This behavior matches known malicious patterns of information-stealing malware."
