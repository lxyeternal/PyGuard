Additionally, the package requires 'requests', a network library often used in malicious code for data exfiltration or payload downloading. The combination of these factors suggests that the package is designed for malicious purposes, despite the note about 'educational purposes only', which is often used to mask harmful intent."

It downloads a Python script from a hardcoded URL (https://blockatlaspro.com/testupp.py) without user consent or validation. The downloaded script is then saved to a hidden directory within the user's AppData folder (~/AppData/Local/App) with a randomly generated filename. The file attributes are set to hidden (2) using ctypes.windll.kernel32.SetFileAttributesW to evade detection. Finally, the script is executed in a new process with output suppressed (stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL), further hiding its activities. These actions—unauthorized download, hidden file creation, stealthy execution—are classic indicators of malware, specifically a dropper/downloader that fetches and runs additional malicious payloads."
