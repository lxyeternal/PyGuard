      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' which executes code from 'main.main()' during package installation. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, allowing arbitrary code execution on the victim's system without their knowledge. The setup also includes 'requests' as a dependency, which could be used for network communication or payload download. The behavior is consistent with malicious packages that execute unwanted actions during installation, such as data exfiltration or further malware deployment."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system and user information (hostname, username, current working directory) and exfiltrates it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs without user consent. These URLs ('dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oqvignkp58-psl.i18n.oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'sbfwstspuutiarcjzptfenn9u0dsxhjlu.oast.fun') appear to be attacker-controlled domains, likely used for data exfiltration or command and control. The use of random numbers in the URL path and URL encoding of parameters further suggests an attempt to evade detection. This behavior is consistent with information-stealing malware or reconnaissance activity prior to further malicious actions."
