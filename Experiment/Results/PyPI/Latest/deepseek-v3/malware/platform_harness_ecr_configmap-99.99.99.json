      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it collects sensitive system information (such as OS info, current working directory, IP configurations, and public IP) without user consent and exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. This behavior is indicative of information-stealing malware, commonly observed in malicious Python packages. Specifically, the code abuses the setuptools install hook to execute during package installation, a technique often seen in supply chain attacks. The data collected is transmitted via an HTTP POST request to an external endpoint, which is a clear sign of unauthorized data exfiltration."
