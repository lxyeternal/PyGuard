      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by executing arbitrary code during package installation via a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat). This is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks, where malicious code is executed automatically when the package is installed, without user awareness. The custom install class imports and executes a 'main' function from a 'main' module, which could perform any arbitrary malicious actions such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or further malware deployment. The package also requires the 'requests' library, which is commonly used in malicious code for network communication and data exfiltration. The setup configuration lacks transparency about the purpose of the executed code, making it highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics indicative of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) without user consent and transmits this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs. The use of random numbers (rd_num) and dynamic URL construction suggests an attempt to evade detection. The domains (oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast-row.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) appear to be attacker-controlled infrastructure commonly associated with malicious activity (e.g., command and control servers or data exfiltration endpoints). The lack of user notification or consent for data collection and transmission, combined with the use of HTTP (not HTTPS) for communication, further strengthens the malicious intent. This behavior aligns with typical information-stealing malware patterns."
