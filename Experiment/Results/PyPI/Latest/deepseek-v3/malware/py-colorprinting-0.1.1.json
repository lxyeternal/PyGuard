      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics typical of malicious behavior. It downloads a ZIP file from a hardcoded URL (https://cosmoplanets.net/well-known/pki-validation/ore-miner.zip), extracts its contents to a temporary directory, and executes an executable file (ore-miner.exe) with subprocess.Popen while suppressing standard output and error streams. The executable is run with creation flags (DETACHED_PROCESS | CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP) that detach it from the parent process, allowing it to run independently and potentially evade detection. The code lacks user notification or consent for these actions, and the broad exception handling (try/except blocks with empty except clauses) suggests an attempt to suppress errors and avoid detection. The combination of downloading, extracting, and executing an external binary without user interaction or transparency is a strong indicator of malware behavior, likely a dropper or miner."
