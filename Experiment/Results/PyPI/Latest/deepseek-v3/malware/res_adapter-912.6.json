      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by defining a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes arbitrary code during package installation. This pattern is commonly used in supply chain attacks to run malicious payloads silently when the package is installed. The setup function specifies this custom install class via the 'cmdclass' parameter, ensuring that the malicious code (importing and executing 'main' from a 'main' module) runs automatically upon installation. Additionally, the minimal and vague package metadata (author, description) lacks transparency, and the inclusion of 'requests' as a dependency suggests potential network exfiltration capabilities."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and exfiltrates it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external domains via HTTP requests. This behavior is consistent with information-stealing malware. The domains (e.g., 'byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun') appear to be attacker-controlled infrastructure commonly used for malicious purposes. The code lacks any legitimate functionality or user consent mechanism for this data collection and transmission, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
