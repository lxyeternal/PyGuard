      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes 'main.main()' during package installation. This behavior is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during installation without user consent, a common technique in supply chain attacks. The setup includes 'requests' as a requirement, which could be used for network communication or data exfiltration. The lack of transparency regarding what 'main.main()' does and the absence of user notification or consent for such execution strongly indicate malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and transmits this data to multiple hardcoded URLs via HTTP without user consent. The URLs appear to be attacker-controlled (e.g., domains like 'oast.fun' and 'byted-dast.com' which are known for C2 traffic). The random number generation (rd_num) may be used to avoid detection of repeated requests, and the broad exception handling suggests an attempt to suppress errors and continue execution silently. This behavior is consistent with information-stealing malware that exfiltrates system details to remote servers for further exploitation."
