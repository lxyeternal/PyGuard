      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes malicious behavior by downloading and executing arbitrary code from a remote server during package installation. Specifically, it imports the 'requests' library to fetch a JSON file from a hardcoded URL (https://slack-dw-javabackend-109783.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/packages/package.json) and then uses 'eval' and 'exec' to execute the fetched code. This behavior is typical of supply chain attacks where malicious code is injected during the installation process to gain remote control or exfiltrate data without user consent. The use of dynamic code execution (eval/exec) with externally fetched content is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
