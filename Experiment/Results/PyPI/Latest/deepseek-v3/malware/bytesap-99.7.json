      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class `CrazyInstallStrat` that executes its `run` method during package installation. Within this method, it executes code from a dynamically imported module (`main.py`) without any user consent or notification. This pattern is commonly associated with malicious Python packages that execute arbitrary code during installation, often for purposes such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or further malware deployment. The combination of a custom install hook, dynamic imports, and immediate execution of unknown code (via `main()`) is a strong indicator of malicious intent, typically used in supply chain attacks."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and attempts to exfiltrate it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external domains via HTTP requests. The domains appear to be deliberately obfuscated or dynamically generated (e.g., 'dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com001', 'oqvignkp58-psl.i18n.oast-row.byted-dast.com'), which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection. The data exfiltration occurs without user consent or notification, and there is no legitimate reason for this behavior within standard Python scripts. This matches multiple characteristics of malicious code, including unauthorized data collection, network exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints, and use of obfuscated domains."
