      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom install class that overrides the run method to execute encrypted and obfuscated code during package installation. The encrypted payload is decrypted using a hardcoded Fernet key and then executed via the exec function, which is a common technique for hiding malicious intent. The payload is only executed on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), indicating targeted behavior. Additionally, the package requires 'fernet' and 'requests' as setup dependencies, which are commonly used in malicious code for encryption and network communication, respectively. The long, obfuscated class name and nonsensical description strings further suggest an attempt to evade detection and analysis."
