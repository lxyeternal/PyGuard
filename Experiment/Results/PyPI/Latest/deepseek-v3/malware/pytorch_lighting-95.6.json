      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that overrides the default 'install' command to execute arbitrary code during package installation. Specifically, it imports and executes a 'main' function from a 'main' module upon installation. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically during package installation without user consent. Additionally, the package name 'pytorch_lighting' appears to be a typosquatting attempt mimicking the legitimate 'pytorch-lightning' package, which further suggests malicious intent. The presence of 'requests' and 'psutil' in dependencies could be used for data exfiltration or system monitoring."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses) without user consent or notification. It then encodes this information (using base64) and exfiltrates it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs via HTTP requests. The URLs appear to be attacker-controlled domains ('oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun'), which are typical of command and control (C2) infrastructure or data exfiltration endpoints. The code suppresses all exceptions during the exfiltration attempts, further hiding its malicious activity. This behavior aligns with information-stealing malware, designed to gather and transmit sensitive system data to an attacker without the user's knowledge."
