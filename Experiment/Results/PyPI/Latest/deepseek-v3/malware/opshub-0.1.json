      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior within the 'status' method of the 'Subsys' class. The method uses base64-decoded and dynamically executed code, which decodes to a payload that downloads and executes arbitrary code from a remote server (http://45.142.115.225:8000/inject/DaTDTcxiSvq9OA6r). This behavior is characteristic of malware, enabling remote code execution and unauthorized system access. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), dynamic code execution (exec, compile), and fetching from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address are all strong indicators of malicious intent."
