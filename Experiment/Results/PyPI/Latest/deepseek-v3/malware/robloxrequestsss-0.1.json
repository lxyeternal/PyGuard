Specifically, it uses PowerShell to download a file from a Dropbox URL ('https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/vckgtlr6pq92uspoj3bku/634364.pyw?rlkey=w2st1zif9lbd4oxz44utimsuv&st=iuvnv9lc&dl=1') and then executes it using pythonw.exe. This behavior is characteristic of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically during package installation without user consent. The use of subprocess.run with shell=True and executing downloaded files poses a significant security risk, as it can lead to arbitrary code execution and potential system compromise."
