      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file ('zwerve.exe') from a GitHub repository using PowerShell and curl.exe, then executes it silently. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators: (1) downloading and executing an untrusted executable from a remote source, (2) using hardcoded suspicious URLs (GitHub repository hosting potentially malicious files), (3) running the executable silently (evasion technique), (4) no user notification or consent for the download/execution, and (5) no verification of the file's legitimacy before execution. These patterns are commonly observed in malware, specifically droppers or downloaders that deliver additional malicious payloads."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file (`zwerve.exe`) from a GitHub repository using PowerShell and then executes it silently. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent for the following reasons: 1) The executable is downloaded from an external source without any user interaction or consent. 2) The execution is done silently (`-NoNewWindow -Wait`), which is a common tactic to avoid detection. 3) There is no validation or verification of the downloaded file's integrity or purpose. 4) The combination of downloading and executing an arbitrary executable is a hallmark of malware, often used for remote code execution or payload delivery."
