      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it exfiltrates sensitive system information (hostname, current working directory, and username) to a specified remote server without user consent or notification. This is achieved through a custom install hook in the setuptools setup process, which runs during package installation. The use of network requests (requests.get) to send this data to a hardcoded IP address (192.198.82.14) is indicative of unauthorized data collection and exfiltration, common in malware. The behavior aligns with characteristics of supply chain attacks where malicious actions are triggered during package installation."
