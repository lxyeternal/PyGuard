      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes arbitrary code (from main import main; main()) during package installation without user consent. This is a common technique in supply chain attacks to achieve remote code execution or perform unauthorized actions on the victim's machine. The pattern of running code during installation (via setuptools hooks) without clear user notification or consent is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. Additionally, the install_requires list includes 'requests' and 'psutil', which are commonly used in malware for network communication and system monitoring, further supporting the malicious classification."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior:\n1. **Data Collection**: It collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses, and randomizes a number for unique identification.\n2. **Data Exfiltration**: It encodes the collected MAC addresses in base64 and transmits this data along with other system details to several hardcoded URLs via HTTP GET requests.\n3. **Hardcoded Suspicious URLs**: The URLs ('dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oqvignkp58-psl.i18n.oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'sbfwstspuutiarcjzptf3c0cvb6yng6mw.oast.fun') appear to be attacker-controlled domains, possibly used for command and control or data exfiltration.\n4. **Stealthy Execution**: The code suppresses all exceptions (broad try-except blocks) to avoid detection and continue execution silently.\n5. **No User Consent**: The code operates without any user notification or consent for data collection and transmission.\n6. **System Fingerprinting**: It performs platform-specific operations to gather MAC addresses, indicating intent to uniquely identify the system.\n\nThese behaviors are consistent with information-stealing malware or spyware that operates without user consent and exfiltrates sensitive data to remote servers controlled by attackers."
