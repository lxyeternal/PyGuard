      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a post-installation script that collects system information (hostname, operating system, and public IP address) and exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded webhook URL ('https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55') without user consent or notification. This behavior is indicative of information-stealing malware, as it combines unauthorized data collection with automated exfiltration to an external, attacker-controlled endpoint. The use of a custom installation hook (PostInstallCommand) for malicious purposes is a hallmark of supply chain attacks."
