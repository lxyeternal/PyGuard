      "malicious_behavior": "The analyzed Python code contains multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It includes functionality to evade debugging (antidebug function), check for virtual machines (check_registry, check_dll), and terminate processes associated with debugging tools. The code also collects and exfiltrates sensitive data such as Discord tokens, browser credentials (passwords, cookies, autofill data, credit cards), and system information to a Discord webhook (h00k variable). Additionally, it searches for and exfiltrates files matching specific keywords (e.g., passwords, wallets) from user directories. The code attempts to maintain persistence by copying itself to the startup folder and uses obfuscation techniques (e.g., variable renaming, base64 encoding) to evade detection. The presence of hardcoded URLs for data exfiltration and the lack of user consent for data collection further confirm its malicious nature."
