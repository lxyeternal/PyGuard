      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes an unknown main() function from a module named 'main' during package installation. This behavior is suspicious as it leverages setuptools installation hooks to run arbitrary code without user consent or notification. The immediate execution of code during installation, combined with the lack of transparency about what 'main()' does, suggests potential for unauthorized actions such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or persistence mechanisms. The inclusion of the 'requests' package in install_requires further raises concerns about possible network communication or data exfiltration capabilities."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and attempts to exfiltrate this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious URLs (e.g., domains like 'oast.fun' and 'byted-dast.com' which are known for malicious activities). The data is transmitted without user consent or notification, using HTTP which is insecure for sensitive data transmission. The URLs appear to be dynamically generated or obfuscated, a common technique in malware to evade detection. This behavior is consistent with information-stealing malware or reconnaissance activities typically observed in malicious software."
