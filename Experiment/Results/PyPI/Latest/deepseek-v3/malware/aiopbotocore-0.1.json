      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes malicious behavior by collecting system information (hostname, operating system, and public IP address) without user consent and exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded webhook URL (https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55) during package installation. This is achieved by overriding the setuptools 'install' command to run the 'send' function post-installation, which performs the data collection and exfiltration. The behavior is consistent with supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware, as it abuses the package installation process for unauthorized data collection and transmission."
