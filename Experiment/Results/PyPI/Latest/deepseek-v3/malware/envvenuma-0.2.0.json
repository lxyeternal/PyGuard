      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hardcoded Google Chat webhook URL (https://chat.googleapis.com/v1/spaces/AAAAV9IzvqY/messages?...), which is used to exfiltrate environment variables. The functions `get_all_env_vars` and `get_all_env` collect all environment variables and send them to the specified webhook without user consent. This behavior is typical of information-stealing malware, as it gathers sensitive system and user data (potentially including credentials, API keys, and other secrets) and transmits it to an external, attacker-controlled endpoint. The use of `subprocess.run(['printenv'])` further indicates an attempt to gather system information stealthily. The absence of user notification or consent for this data collection and transmission is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
