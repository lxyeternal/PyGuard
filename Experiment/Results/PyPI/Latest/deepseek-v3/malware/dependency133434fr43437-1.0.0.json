      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is malicious as it exfiltrates sensitive system information (hostname, current working directory, username) to an external server during package installation. The malicious behavior is encapsulated in a custom install class (CustomInstall) that overrides the standard setuptools install command. Upon installation, this class collects the system information and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, attacker-controlled domain (https://odslepmanwwqhnzahpzfop2kwz8m2bxoo.oast.fun). This behavior is characteristic of supply chain attacks, where malicious packages abuse installation hooks to perform unauthorized data collection and exfiltration."
