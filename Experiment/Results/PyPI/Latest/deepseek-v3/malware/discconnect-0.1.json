      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior. It defines a custom installation command that downloads an executable from a hardcoded URL ('https://filetransfer.io/data-package/MG85ggQt/download') and saves it to the user's LOCALAPPDATA directory as 'Driver.exe'. After downloading, it executes the file using ctypes.windll.kernel32.WinExec. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack where malicious code is executed during package installation without user consent. The use of requests to download and ctypes to execute the file, combined with no user notification or consent, aligns with typical malware tactics for remote code execution and persistence."
