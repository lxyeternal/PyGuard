      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes an imported function 'main()' from 'main.py' during package installation. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation without user consent. The use of installation hooks for arbitrary code execution is a hallmark of malicious packages, as it enables remote code execution, data exfiltration, and further malware deployment. Additionally, the lack of transparency regarding the purpose of the 'main()' function and its actions further supports the classification of this code as malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and sends it to multiple hardcoded external URLs without user consent. This behavior is typical of information-stealing malware, where data is exfiltrated to attacker-controlled servers. The use of random numbers for URL generation and multiple fallback domains suggests an attempt to evade detection and ensure successful data exfiltration."
