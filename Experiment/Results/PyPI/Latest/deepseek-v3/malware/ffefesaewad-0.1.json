      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains encoded and dynamically executed payload using base64 and exec functions, which are common techniques in malicious code to obfuscate and execute harmful instructions. The specific decoded command 'print(\"test\")' appears benign, but the methodology is suspicious and could easily be replaced with harmful commands without detection. This pattern is often used in malware to evade static analysis tools and execute arbitrary code."
