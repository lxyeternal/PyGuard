      "malicious_behavior": "The code establishes a reverse shell connection to a hardcoded IP address (3.36.68.86) and port (16000), which is a clear indicator of malicious behavior. It creates a socket connection to the specified remote host and enters an infinite loop where it receives commands from the remote server, executes them locally using subprocess.getoutput, and sends the output back to the remote server. This behavior allows for remote command execution on the victim's machine, which is a common tactic used by attackers to gain control over compromised systems. The use of subprocess to execute arbitrary commands without any input validation or security checks further confirms the malicious intent of this code."
