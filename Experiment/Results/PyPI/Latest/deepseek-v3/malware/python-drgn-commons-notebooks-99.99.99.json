      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it collects sensitive system information (e.g., OS details, IP configurations, current working directory, and public IP) without user consent and exfiltrates it to an external Slack webhook (https://hooks.slack.com/services/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) automatically during package installation. This behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware, which can lead to privacy violations and potential system compromise."
