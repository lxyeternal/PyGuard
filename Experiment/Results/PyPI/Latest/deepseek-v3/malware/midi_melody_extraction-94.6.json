      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes a main function from 'main' module during package installation. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, where malicious code is executed automatically upon installation without user consent. The execution of arbitrary code during installation, combined with the lack of transparency regarding what 'main.main()' does, and the presence of network-related dependencies ('requests', 'psutil') suggests potential for data exfiltration, remote code execution, or other malicious activities. Such patterns are exclusively observed in malware and are never present in legitimate packages."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) and transmits it to several externally hosted URLs without user consent or notification. The URLs appear suspicious (oast, byted-dast domains) and are typically associated with malicious behavior. The collected MAC addresses are base64 encoded before transmission, likely to obfuscate the data being sent. The script uses broad exception handling to suppress any errors during execution, which is a common technique to avoid detection. These behaviors are indicative of information stealing malware, commonly used for reconnaissance or initial stages of a cyber attack."
