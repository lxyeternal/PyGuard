      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes a function 'main' from 'main' module during package installation. This behavior is suspicious as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent. The pattern of overriding installation hooks to execute additional code is commonly associated with malicious packages aiming to perform unwanted actions such as data exfiltration or system compromise. The presence of 'requests' and 'psutil' in install_requires further raises concerns as these libraries could be used for network communication and system monitoring respectively, typical of malware behavior."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior: It collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) without user consent. The collected data is encoded (base64) and exfiltrated to external, attacker-controlled URLs via HTTP requests. The URLs appear to be suspicious or generated domains (e.g., *.oast.fun, *.byted-dast.com), which are commonly used for data exfiltration in malware. The code suppresses all exceptions during the exfiltration attempt, indicating an attempt to evade detection. The combination of system information gathering, encoding, and unsolicited network communication to hardcoded domains is a strong indicator of information-stealing malware."
