      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class 'CustomInstall' that inherits from 'install' and overrides the 'run' method to collect system information (hostname and username) and exfiltrate it to an external attacker-controlled domain using DNS lookups (via os.popen and nslookup). The data is base64-encoded before being sent, which is a common technique to avoid detection. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration and poses a significant security risk. The package setup itself is likely a disguise for delivering malware, as it abusing the Python package installation process for malicious activities."
