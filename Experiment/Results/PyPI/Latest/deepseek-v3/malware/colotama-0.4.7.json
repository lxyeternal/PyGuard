      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior. It defines a custom install class that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute a post-installation task. The post-installation task (_post_install function) uses subprocess.call to execute arbitrary commands (shell=True), which is a significant security risk. The command executed is constructed dynamically using sys.executable and a file path (colotama), indicating potential for arbitrary code execution. The use of installation hooks to execute custom code during package installation is a common malware technique (supply chain attack vector). The code also lacks transparency about its actions, with no documentation or clear benign purpose for the post-install execution. Additionally, the code prints long separator lines (200 characters of semicolons, hyphens, and question marks) which could be an attempt to obfuscate its output among legitimate installation messages. The combination of these factors strongly suggests malicious intent, specifically the potential for arbitrary code execution during package installation."
