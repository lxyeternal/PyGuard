      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes arbitrary code during package installation by importing and running a main function from a module named 'main'. This behavior is typical of supply chain attacks, where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation without user awareness. The use of a custom install hook to execute code without explicit user consent is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Combined with the lack of transparency about what the 'main' function does and the presence of 'requests' in install_requires (often used for data exfiltration), this strongly suggests the code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior: 1. It collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) without user consent. 2. It transmits this information to multiple hardcoded suspicious URLs (e.g., domains containing 'oast' which are often associated with attacker-controlled servers). 3. The URLs appear to be dynamic or generated (e.g., 'byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun'), which is a common technique for evading detection. 4. The data transmission includes potentially identifiable information which could be used for tracking or further attacks. 5. The code includes minimal error handling and logging, which suggests an attempt to hide its activities rather than provide transparent operation."
