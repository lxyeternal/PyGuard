      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes arbitrary code (from main import main, main()) during the package installation process, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. This behavior allows malicious code to run automatically during installation, potentially leading to unauthorized actions such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or further malware deployment. The use of requests and psutil in install_requires suggests potential network communication or system monitoring capabilities, further supporting the malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) without user consent, encodes this data (base64), and transmits it to multiple hardcoded external URLs ('http://dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'http://sbfwstspuutiarcjzptf3c0cvb6yng6mw.oast.fun'). This behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware, which exfiltrates data to attacker-controlled servers. The use of randomized URLs and suppressed error handling (empty try-except blocks) further indicates malicious intent designed to evade detection."
