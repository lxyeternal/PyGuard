      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an executable file (putty.exe) from an external URL without user consent during the package installation process. Specifically, it overrides the standard setuptools install command to run a custom function (send) that downloads the executable and executes it using os.system. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation, potentially leading to unauthorized remote code execution, data theft, or further malware deployment. The use of requests.get to download the file and os.system to execute it directly is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
