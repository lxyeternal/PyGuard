      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it exfiltrates sensitive system information (hostname, current working directory, username) to a remote server without user consent. The CustomInstall class overrides the standard install command to perform data collection and transmission during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of hardcoded IP addresses (192.198.82.14) and network requests (requests.get) for exfiltration further confirms malicious intent."
