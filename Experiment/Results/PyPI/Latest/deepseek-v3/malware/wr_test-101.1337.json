      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior. It makes an external HTTP request to a hardcoded URL (http://jacobsandum.com:1337/setup-) during the setup process, exfiltrating the hostname of the system without user consent or notification. This behavior is typical of malware that performs data exfiltration or checks in with a command-and-control server. Additionally, the package description explicitly warns 'Do NOT USE, only for testing supply chain,' which is suspicious and suggests the package might be intended for malicious testing or supply chain attacks."

The hostname and directory information are combined and transmitted without user consent or legitimate purpose, indicating potential reconnaissance or data exfiltration intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior. It collects system information (current working directory and hostname) and transmits this data to an external server (http://jacobsandum.com:8000/) without user consent or notification. This is a classic sign of data exfiltration, where sensitive information is sent to an attacker-controlled server. The use of os.system with curl to make HTTP requests to a hardcoded URL further confirms the malicious intent, as it combines system command execution with network communication to an external domain."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a curl command to an external URL (http://jacobsandum.com:1337/adfslogin) via os.system. This behavior is indicative of potential malicious activity because:\n1. It connects to an external server without user consent.\n2. The URL is hardcoded, which is a common tactic in malware for command and control (C2) communication.\n3. There is no legitimate reason provided for accessing this URL, suggesting possible data exfiltration or payload download.\n4. The use of a non-standard port (1337) is often associated with malicious servers.\n5. The code lacks any form of input validation, error handling, or user notification, which are typical in benign code."

This data string is then sent via an HTTP GET request to an external server (http://jacobsandum.com:8000/) using the curl command. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration, as it sends potentially sensitive directory and system information to a remote server without user consent. The use of a hardcoded external URL for data transmission is a strong indicator of malicious intent, commonly observed in information-stealing malware or spyware."
