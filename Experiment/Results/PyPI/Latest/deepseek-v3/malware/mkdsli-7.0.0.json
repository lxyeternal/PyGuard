      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several indicators of malicious behavior. It overrides the setuptools install command to collect sensitive system information (hostname, current working directory, username) and exfiltrates this data to an external server ('http://qpaw5pjg.requestrepo.com') without user consent. This behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware and supply chain attacks, where malicious actions are triggered during package installation. The combination of system reconnaissance and unsolicited network communication to a hardcoded, suspicious domain is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
