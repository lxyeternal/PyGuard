      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom installation class (CustomInstall) that executes potentially harmful actions during package installation. Specifically, it collects system information (via 'id' command), enumerates the directory structure of '/etc/', and encodes this data using base64. Although the 'send_put_request' function is non-functional (it raises an exception), its presence suggests an intent to exfiltrate collected data. The setup.py script disguises these actions as part of a legitimate package installation process, which is a common technique in supply chain attacks. Additionally, the package name 'f2d5cfdc642c3d4' appears randomly generated, which is suspicious and often used in malicious packages to evade detection."
