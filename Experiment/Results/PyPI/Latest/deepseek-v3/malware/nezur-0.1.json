      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior. Firstly, it overrides the standard install command in setuptools to execute custom code during package installation. This custom code downloads an executable file ('CBLines.exe') from a GitHub repository using PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest command. The downloaded file is then executed immediately using Start-Process without any user consent or notification. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed during package installation to potentially compromise the system. Downloading and executing arbitrary executables from external sources without verification poses a significant security risk. Furthermore, the setup.py file does not provide any legitimate functionality related to the package's described purpose ('A sleek Hash/Encryption management process'), suggesting that its primary intent is to deliver and execute the malicious payload."
