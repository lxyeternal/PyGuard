      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes malicious behavior during package installation by collecting system information (hostname and username) and exfiltrating it to an external domain via DNS lookup. Specifically, it uses the 'os.popen' function to execute a command that sends encoded hostname and username data to 'tnclzdakriptzmhikqzyjbi9hzhnt0ord.oast.fun', which appears to be a domain dynamically generated for data exfiltration. This behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware designed to gather sensitive system/user data without consent and transmit it to an attacker-controlled endpoint."
