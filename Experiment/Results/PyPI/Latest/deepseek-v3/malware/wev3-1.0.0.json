      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior: 1) It defines a custom install class that executes arbitrary code during package installation. 2) It uses Fernet encryption to hide a malicious payload (hardcoded key and encrypted command). 3) It dynamically executes the decrypted payload using exec(), which could perform any malicious action. 4) The behavior is Windows-specific (checks for os.name == 'nt'). 5) The package requires 'fernet' and 'requests' which are common in malware for encryption/decryption and network communication. 6) The description fields contain nonsensical strings, possibly attempting to evade detection. 7) The custom install class has an obfuscated, meaningless name. This pattern is characteristic of supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation."
