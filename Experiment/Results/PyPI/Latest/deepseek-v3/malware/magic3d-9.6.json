      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes a function 'main()' from a module 'main' during package installation. This is a classic example of a supply chain attack where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation without user consent. The behavior is suspicious because: 1) It executes arbitrary code during installation (a hallmark of malware), 2) It lacks transparency about what 'main()' does, 3) The setup.py appears to be a facade for executing hidden functionality, and 4) The author details are generic ('anon') which is often used in malicious packages to avoid attribution. Additionally, the package requires 'requests' and 'psutil', which are commonly used in malware for network communication and system monitoring respectively."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple characteristics of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses) without user consent. It then encodes this information (using base64) and attempts to exfiltrate it to multiple hardcoded suspicious URLs (e.g., domains ending with 'oast.fun', '.com' with unusual subdomains). The URLs appear to be dynamically generated or attacker-controlled (common malware exfiltration technique). The code suppresses all errors (broad except block), hiding any failed exfiltration attempts. The combination of system information gathering, encoding, and unsolicited transmission to external domains is a strong indicator of information-stealing malware or reconnaissance activity for potential further attacks."
