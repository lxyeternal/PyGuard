      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior. It checks for running processes (`tasklist` on Windows, `ps ax` on other systems), encodes and decodes data using compression and base64 in an obfuscated manner, and communicates with a hardcoded remote server (`HTTPSConnection` with decoded endpoints). Notably, it collects the current user's login name (`getlogin`) and sends encoded data to a remote server via a POST request without user consent. The use of dynamic and obfuscated URLs, combined with system information gathering and unauthorized data transmission, strongly suggests malicious intent, likely for data exfiltration or command-and-control purposes."
