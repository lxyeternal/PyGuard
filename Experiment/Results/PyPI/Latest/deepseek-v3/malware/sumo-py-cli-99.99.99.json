      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class that collects sensitive system information (including OS details, current working directory, network configuration, and public IP) during package installation. This data is then exfiltrated to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL without user consent or notification. The behavior is indicative of information-stealing malware, as it combines unauthorized data collection with automated exfiltration to an external, attacker-controlled endpoint. The use of installation hooks for such behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks."
