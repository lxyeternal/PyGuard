      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to download and execute a reverse shell payload from a remote GitHub repository. The payload is customized with a hardcoded IP address and port, indicating the intent to establish a remote connection to an attacker-controlled server. The code checks for the presence of Python interpreters and executes the payload in the background without user consent. This behavior is characteristic of malware designed to enable remote control of the victim's system. The inclusion of these actions within a setuptools setup script further suggests an attempt to distribute this malicious functionality as a seemingly legitimate Python package."
