      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class that collects system information (such as uname, ifconfig, systeminfo, public IP, hostname, and current working directory) without user consent and exfiltrates it to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL during package installation. This behavior is indicative of information-stealing malware, as it gathers sensitive host data and sends it to an external, attacker-controlled server. The use of installation hooks for data collection and exfiltration is a common tactic in supply chain attacks."
