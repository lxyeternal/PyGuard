      "malicious_behavior": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by executing arbitrary system commands during package installation without user consent. Specifically, it executes the following commands: 1. 'touch /tmp/pwn' (creates a file in /tmp, possibly for persistence or marking the system), 2. 'cat /etc/hostname' (reads and prints the system's hostname), 3. 'ls -al' (lists directory contents, potentially for reconnaissance). This pattern is characteristic of supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation, enabling unauthorized system access and data exfiltration."
