      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains base64-encoded Discord webhook URLs (variables __x0__, __x1__, __x2__, and __x3__) which decode to URLs typically used for data exfiltration. The code includes functions that collect sensitive system information (__sys__), scrape Discord tokens (__dscan__), extract Chrome passwords (__browser__), and collect Minecraft account details (__mc__). These functions are called by __exfil__, which sends the collected data to the Discord webhooks. This behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware, which collects and exfiltrates sensitive user data without consent."
