      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated strings (self.salt) that are evaluated at runtime using eval(compile(...)), which is a common technique for hiding malicious behavior. Additionally, the code performs dynamic code execution by evaluating the obfuscated salt string, which could be used to download and execute arbitrary code from an external source. The combination of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and potential remote code fetching strongly indicates malicious intent."
