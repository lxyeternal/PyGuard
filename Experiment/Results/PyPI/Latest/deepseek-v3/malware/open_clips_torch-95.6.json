      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that extends setuptools.command.install and overrides the run() method to execute code from a module named 'main' during package installation. This pattern is characteristic of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation without user awareness. The setup configuration includes installation hooks ('cmdclass') that invoke this malicious behavior, and requires 'requests' and 'psutil', which are commonly used in malicious code for data exfiltration and system monitoring. This behavior enables arbitrary code execution during package installation, posing severe risks to system integrity and security."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) and exfiltrates it to multiple hardcoded suspicious URLs without user consent. The MAC addresses are additionally encoded using base64 before transmission. The use of hardcoded, suspicious domains and the lack of user notification or consent for data collection and transmission are strong indicators of malicious behavior. The code also suppresses errors during the exfiltration attempt, further indicating malicious intent to avoid detection."
