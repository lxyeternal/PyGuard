      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that is executed during package installation. This class imports and executes a 'main' function from a 'main' module, which is not standard behavior for legitimate package installations. This pattern is commonly used in supply chain attacks to execute arbitrary code during installation without user consent. Additionally, the setup function specifies 'requests' as a required dependency, which could be used for network communication or downloading further malicious payloads. The combination of custom install hooks and potential network activity poses a significant security risk."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) without user consent and attempts to exfiltrate this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious URLs (e.g., 'dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oqvignkp58-psl.i18n.oast-row.byted-dast.com'). These domains appear to be dynamically generated and resemble command-and-control (C2) infrastructure. The use of urllib.request.urlopen to transmit data without encryption or user notification further confirms malicious intent. Additionally, the code suppresses errors with a broad exception handler, which is a common evasion technique in malware."
