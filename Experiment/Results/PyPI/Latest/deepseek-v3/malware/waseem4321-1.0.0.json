      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes during package installation (via a custom install class) and collects extensive system information (hostname, current working directory, username, platform details, CPU and RAM information, Python installation paths, etc.). This sensitive data is then exfiltrated to two remote endpoints: a Webhook.site URL and a Burp Collaborator URL. The collection and transmission of system information without user consent, combined with the use of custom installation hooks for this purpose, is indicative of malicious behavior. This pattern is commonly observed in malware that aims to gather intelligence about infected systems or establish persistence."
