      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated strings and dynamic code execution using eval, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The function 'custom_command' constructs a URL ('wget oastify.com') and executes it via eval, suggesting potential command and control communication or data exfiltration. Additionally, the code abuses setuptools hooks (install, develop, egg_info) to execute malicious code during package installation, a common technique in supply chain attacks. The lack of legitimate package functionality and the presence of obfuscation further confirm the malicious nature of this code."
