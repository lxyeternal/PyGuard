      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes a main function from a module (main) during package installation without user consent. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, allowing arbitrary code execution during installation (a common malicious technique for persistence, data exfiltration, or malware deployment). The code also includes requests as a dependency, suggesting potential network communication (exfiltration or payload downloading). The setup.py's primary purpose appears to be executing external code rather than legitimate package setup, which is strongly indicative of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and exfiltrates it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external domains via HTTP requests. This behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware, as it involves unauthorized data collection and transmission to attacker-controlled servers without user consent. The use of random numbers in the URL path and the lack of legitimate functionality further indicate malicious intent."
