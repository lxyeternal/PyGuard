      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior: 1) It uses a custom install class (xrVqeXeNokDdrdXhcpNSLbwZSvnfnceVyBLOjdhfMQfcanAMammSiemyVYDUISVxjMehntxlwGMkxOlsgNpbixNvwfVpulGDXIAzQhlNRv) that executes arbitrary code during package installation, specifically targeting Windows systems (os.name == \"nt\"). 2) The payload is encrypted using Fernet (a symmetric encryption method) and is decoded and executed dynamically using 'exec', which is a common technique to hide malicious intent. 3) The payload is fetched from an encrypted source (Fernet with key '38N2l3nvHBg7Ry0rHKLwnRWMMmuTQki83uNNjZ4xWs0=') and executed without user consent, indicating potential remote code execution or data exfiltration. 4) The setup.py includes non-descriptive, obfuscated strings (e.g., DESCRIPTION, LONG_DESCRIPTION) and a misleading package name (\"we3b\"), which are typical of malicious packages attempting to evade detection. 5) The setup.py requires 'fernet' and 'requests' packages, suggesting it may attempt to exfiltrate data or download further malicious payloads."
