      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it captures environment variables and exfiltrates them to an external server via a POST request to 'https://e433-37-47-198-94.ngrok-free.app'. This is a clear example of data exfiltration, a hallmark of malicious activity. The use of environment variables, which can contain sensitive information such as API keys, credentials, and configuration details, combined with unauthorized network transmission to an attacker-controlled endpoint, indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code disguises this behavior within a seemingly benign package setup, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks."
