      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior, including the use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), dynamic code execution via system calls, and temporary file creation and execution. It writes a base64-decoded payload to a temporary file and executes it with system-level privileges, passing command-line arguments directly to the executed script. This pattern is commonly associated with malware that aims to evade detection by unpacking and executing malicious code dynamically. Additionally, the code lacks transparency regarding its intended purpose and does not provide user notification or consent for these actions."
