      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute arbitrary code (from main import main) during package installation. This is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks, enabling malicious payloads to run automatically without user knowledge or consent. The pattern of using installation hooks for unauthorized code execution is consistently associated with malware, as it allows for persistence, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple characteristics of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, which are then encoded in base64. This data is exfiltrated to multiple hardcoded external URLs via unprotected HTTP connections. The URLs appear to be suspicious domains (e.g., oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) that resemble command-and-control or data exfiltration endpoints. The code lacks any legitimate purpose for this data collection and transmission, operates without user consent, and suppresses all errors to hide its activities. The combination of system reconnaissance, data encoding, and network exfiltration to multiple hardcoded domains is a strong indicator of information-stealing malicious software."
