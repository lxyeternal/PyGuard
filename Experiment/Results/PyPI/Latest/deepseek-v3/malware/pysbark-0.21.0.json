      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install command (CustomInstallCommand) that collects the user's login name and hostname, encodes this information in base64, and then performs a DNS lookup to an external domain (oast.live) with the encoded data. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration, where sensitive system information is being sent to an attacker-controlled server without the user's knowledge or consent. The use of subprocess.run with shell=True also poses a security risk as it can lead to command injection vulnerabilities. The combination of system information gathering, encoding, and unsolicited network communication to a hardcoded suspicious domain is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
