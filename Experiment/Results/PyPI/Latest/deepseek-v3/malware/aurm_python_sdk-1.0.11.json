It then attempts to modify '.zshrc' and '.bash_profile' to execute this file upon shell startup, indicating persistence mechanisms. The download and execution of remote code without user consent is a clear sign of malicious intent, as it can lead to unauthorized remote code execution, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. Additionally, the use of broad exception handling suppresses errors, which is typical of malware trying to evade detection."
