      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute code from a module named 'main' during package installation. This is a common technique used in supply chain attacks to execute malicious code when a package is installed. The behavior is suspicious because legitimate packages typically do not execute arbitrary code during installation unless it is clearly documented and necessary for setup purposes. The presence of 'requests' in install_requires further raises concerns about potential network communication or data exfiltration."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains behavior typical of information-stealing malware. It collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and exfiltrates it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious remote URLs. The exfiltration is performed without user consent or notification, and the URLs (e.g., .oast-cn.byted-dast.com, .oast.fun) resemble domains used for out-of-band application security testing (OAST), often leveraged by attackers for data exfiltration. Additionally, the use of random numbers in the URL paths suggests an attempt to evade detection."
