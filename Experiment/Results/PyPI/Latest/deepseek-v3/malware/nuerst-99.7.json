      "malicious_behavior": "The code hijacks the package installation process by defining a custom install class `CrazyInstallStrat` that executes an imported `main` function during installation. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation without user awareness or consent. The code also includes the `requests` library in its dependencies, which could be used for network communication or data exfiltration. Such patterns are consistently observed in malware and have no legitimate use in benign software."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and exfiltrates this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs (including domains like 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com' and 'oast.fun', which are known for malicious command-and-control activity). The URLs are hardcoded and appear to be dynamically generated or obfuscated, which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection. The code uses randomized parameters (rd_num) and URL encoding to further obscure the data being transmitted. No user consent or notification is provided for this data collection and exfiltration. The combination of system information gathering, hardcoded attacker-controlled domains, and unsolicited network communication is a hallmark of information-stealing malware."
