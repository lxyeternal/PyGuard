      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior. Firstly, it attempts to send a network request to a hardcoded, suspicious domain ('https://5z5bg56mebksjokqd36na9fbq2wvkl8a.oastify.com') upon import. This is indicative of data exfiltration or communication with a command-and-control server. Secondly, it checks the SHA-1 hash of the hostname and silently exits if it doesn't match a specific value, suggesting this could be a targeted attack or a way to avoid executing on certain systems (sandbox evasion). The execution is performed in a separate thread to avoid blocking package import, which is a common technique used by malicious packages to hide their activities. The lack of user consent and transparency regarding the network communication further confirms the malicious intent."
