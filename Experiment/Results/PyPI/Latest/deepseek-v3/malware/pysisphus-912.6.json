      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes the 'main' function from 'main' module upon package installation. This behavior is executed automatically during package installation without user consent, which is a common technique in malicious packages to achieve persistence or execute unauthorized code. The setup includes 'requests' as a dependency, suggesting potential network communication for data exfiltration or payload download. The pattern of triggering code execution during installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is not observed in benign packages."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and exfiltrates it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs via HTTP. This behavior is indicative of information-stealing malware, as it performs unauthorized data collection and transmission without user consent. The presence of random number generation in the URLs suggests an attempt to evade detection or tracking. The combination of system reconnaissance and automated exfiltration to attacker-controlled domains is a hallmark of malicious activity."
