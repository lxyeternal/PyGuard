      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior by collecting system information (hostname, operating system, and IP address) and exfiltrating it to a remote webhook (https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55) during the package installation process. This is done without user consent or notification. The use of setuptools installation hooks for data collection and exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent, commonly seen in supply chain attacks."
