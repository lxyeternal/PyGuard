      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by defining a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes arbitrary code during package installation. This class imports and executes a function 'main' from a module 'main' upon installation, which is highly suspicious and indicative of a supply chain attack. Additionally, the setup requires 'requests' and 'psutil', which are commonly used in malicious code for network communication and system monitoring, respectively. The lack of transparency about what 'main' does and the execution of code during installation without user consent are strong indicators of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) and sends it encoded in base64 to multiple hardcoded external URLs without user consent or knowledge. The URLs include suspicious domains (oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) that are commonly used as attacker-controlled servers in malware and penetration testing tools that simulate attacks. The combination of system reconnaissance, obfuscation (base64 encoding), and automated transmission to known malicious domains is a hallmark of information-stealing malware. Additionally, the code suppresses all errors and exceptions, which is indicative of malware attempting to hide its malicious behavior."
