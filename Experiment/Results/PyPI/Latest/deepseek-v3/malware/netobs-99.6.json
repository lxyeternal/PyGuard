      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that extends setuptools' install command. During package installation, it executes code dynamically imported from 'main' module (via 'from main import m; m()'). This pattern is commonly used in supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation without user consent. The behavior is suspicious because legitimate packages rarely need to execute arbitrary code during installation. Importantly, the imported code ('main.m') is not visible in the provided snippet, but the pattern of execution during install is a strong indicator of potential malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, then encodes this information with base64. It then transmits this data to three hardcoded, obfuscated URLs via HTTP GET requests. These URLs are decoded from BASE64 and include suspicious-looking domains ('oas.byted-dast.com'). The code suppresses all errors and operates silently. This behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware, where sensitive data is exfiltrated to attacker-controlled servers without user consent or knowledge. The use of obfuscation (BASE64-encoded URLs), suppression of errors, and lack of user notification or legitimate purpose strongly indicate malicious intent."
