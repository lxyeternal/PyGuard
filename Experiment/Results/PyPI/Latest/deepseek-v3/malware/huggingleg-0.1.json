      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command to download a binary file ('pytorch') from an external IP address (122.51.221.63) using wget, makes it executable with chmod, and then runs it in the background with nohup. This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of malware, as it involves downloading and executing untrusted code from an external source without user consent. The use of a hardcoded IP address for downloading and executing a binary is a strong indicator of malicious intent, potentially leading to further compromise of the system."
