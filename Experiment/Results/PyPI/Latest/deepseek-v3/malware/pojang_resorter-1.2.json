      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it executes an executable file ('your_executable.exe') during the package installation process without user consent or notification. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. The use of subprocess.run to execute an external executable during installation is highly suspicious and is typically used in malware to deploy payloads, steal data, or establish persistence. There is no legitimate reason for a Python package to execute an external executable during installation in this manner."
