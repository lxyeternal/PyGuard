      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior. Notably, it includes a hardcoded encoded string (self.salt) that, when evaluated using eval(self.salt), potentially executes a remote request to download and execute additional code. This dynamic code execution via eval is a common technique used in malware to obfuscate and execute payloads. Additionally, the code collects user tokens and signs requests without clear user notification or consent, which could facilitate unauthorized data exfiltration. The use of hashlib for generating signatures, while not inherently malicious, is suspicious in the context of potentially masking command and control (C2) communications."
