      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it collects sensitive system information (hostname, current working directory, and username) during package installation and exfiltrates this data to a remote server (https://odslepmanwwqhnzahpzfmu6amv5mt5vvq.oast.fun) without user consent. This is a classic example of a supply chain attack where a seemingly benign package performs unauthorized data collection and exfiltration. The use of a custom install class (CustomInstall) to execute this behavior during installation is a common tactic in malicious Python packages to avoid detection."
