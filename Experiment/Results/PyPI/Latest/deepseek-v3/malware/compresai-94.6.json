      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes code from an imported module (main.main()) during package installation. This behavior is characteristic of supply chain attacks, where malicious code is executed automatically during package installation without user consent. The setup script also requires 'requests' and 'psutil', which could be used for network communication and system monitoring, potentially enabling data exfiltration or other malicious activities. The lack of transparency about what 'main.main()' does and the execution of arbitrary code during installation are strong indicators of malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior, including data collection of sensitive system information (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses), encoding collected data (base64 encoding of MAC addresses), and exfiltration of this data to hardcoded, suspicious external domains (e.g., dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oqvignkp58-psl.i18n.oast-row.byted-dast.com, sbfwstspuutiarcjzptf3c0cvb6yng6mw.oast.fun). The use of broad exception handling (try/except blocks) to suppress errors further indicates evasion techniques typical of malware. This combination of data harvesting, encoding, and unsolicited network communication is indicative of information-stealing malware or reconnaissance activities."
