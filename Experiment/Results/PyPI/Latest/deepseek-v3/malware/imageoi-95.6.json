      "malicious_behavior": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by overriding the standard installation process to execute arbitrary code from a separate 'main' module during package installation. This is a common technique in supply chain attacks where malicious payloads are executed without user awareness during what appears to be a legitimate package installation. The use of a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that runs imported code (from main import main) immediately after installation is highly suspicious and aligns with malicious patterns observed in malware. This behavior could lead to unauthorized code execution, data exfiltration, or further compromise of the system."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior: 1) It collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) without user consent. 2) It encodes the collected data (MAC addresses in base64) for potential exfiltration. 3) It attempts to send this information to multiple hardcoded, suspicious-looking domains (all containing 'oast' which is commonly associated with testing/dynamic DNS services often used by attackers). 4) The domains appear to be attacker-controlled infrastructure. 5) The code uses broad exception handling to suppress errors, making failures invisible to the user. These behaviors collectively indicate an information-stealing malware attempting to exfiltrate system fingerprinting data to remote servers."
