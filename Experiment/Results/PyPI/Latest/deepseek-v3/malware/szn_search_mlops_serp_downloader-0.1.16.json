      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed using the `exec` function. The decoded payload reveals malicious behavior: it imports modules like `os`, `urllib.request`, and `platform`, constructs a URL based on the system platform, and attempts to download and execute content from an external source using `wget`. This behavior is indicative of a remote code execution (RCE) attack, where the code can download and execute arbitrary commands on the victim's system without their consent. Additionally, the use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) and dynamic execution (`exec`) are common techniques used in malware to evade detection and analysis."
