      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install command (PostInstallCommand) that runs an executable (your_executable.exe) during the package installation process. This behavior is suspicious because it attempts to execute an external binary without explicit user consent or transparent verification. Additionally, the code lacks clear documentation or rationale for running this executable, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks where malicious payloads are delivered via seemingly benign packages. The presence of subprocess.run([exe_path], check=True) is particularly concerning as it can execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to remote code execution or system compromise."
