      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes a function 'main' from a module 'main' during package installation. This behavior is suspicious because it leverages setuptools installation hooks to execute arbitrary code without user consent. The lack of documentation about what 'main' does, combined with the fact that the package requires 'requests' and 'psutil' (modules often used in malicious code for network communication and system monitoring), strongly suggests potential malicious intent. Additionally, the author details are generic ('anon'), which is a red flag for potential malicious packages. This pattern is consistent with supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the collected MAC addresses using base64. The code then attempts to exfiltrate this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious URLs (e.g., 'http://dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'http://oqvignkp58-psl.i18n.oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'http://sbfwstspuutiarcjzptf0rueg2x53eh2c.oast.fun'). These URLs appear to be dynamically generated or obfuscated, which is a common technique used in malware to evade detection. The code lacks any user notification or consent for data collection and transmission, and it suppresses all exceptions to avoid detection. The combination of system reconnaissance, data encoding, and unsolicited network communication is a hallmark of information-stealing malware."
