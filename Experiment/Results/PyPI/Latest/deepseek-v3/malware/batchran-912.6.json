      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by defining a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that extends setuptools.command.install. This class overrides the run method to execute arbitrary code (from main import main; main()) during package installation, which is a common technique in supply chain attacks. The pattern of executing code during installation without user consent is a hallmark of malicious packages, enabling remote code execution, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. Additionally, the package requires 'requests', which could be used for network communication or downloading malicious payloads. The lack of transparency about what 'main()' does further increases suspicion of malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple characteristics of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) without user consent and exfiltrates it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious URLs (e.g., domains containing 'byted-dast.com' and 'oast.fun', which are known for attacker-controlled infrastructure). The data is sent via HTTP requests, which is insecure and typical of data exfiltration in malware. Additionally, the code uses logging to mask its activities, employs random numbers to potentially evade detection, and lacks any legitimate purpose for collecting and transmitting this information. The combination of system reconnaissance, unauthorized data collection, and communication with suspicious domains is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing malware."
