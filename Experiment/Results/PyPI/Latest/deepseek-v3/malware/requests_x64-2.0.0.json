Specifically, it downloads 'python-3.13.1-amd64.exe' from a suspicious URL ('https://send.tresorit.com/a#oPaBw2_7GrteEiXwSSI29g') and runs it using subprocess.run. This behavior is consistent with malware that performs remote code execution, payload delivery, or system compromise. The setup.py script, which is typically used for package installation, is hijacked to perform malicious actions during installation, indicating a supply chain attack vector. The lack of user interaction, error suppression, and remote file execution are hallmarks of malicious activity."
