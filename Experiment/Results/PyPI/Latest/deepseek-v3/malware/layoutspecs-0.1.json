The send() function collects sensitive system information including the machine name, operating system, and IP address, and exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded webhook URL (https://webhook-test.com/8caf20007640ce1a4d2843af7b479eb1) without user consent or notification. This behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware and constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration."
