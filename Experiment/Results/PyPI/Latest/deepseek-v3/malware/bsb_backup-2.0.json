      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits multiple characteristics of malicious behavior. It starts with extensive Bengali language comments containing repetitive threatening messages warning against decoding, indicating potential obfuscation intent. The code then utilizes multiple layers of obfuscation techniques including base64 encoding, marshaling, zlib compression, and hex encoding to hide its true functionality. The decoded content reveals setup logic for a package named 'bsb-backup' which claims to be a backup tool but contains suspicious components including real-time data transmission to Telegram (a common exfiltration channel for malware). Additional red flags include execution of encoded/compressed/encrypted payloads during package installation (supply chain attack vector), and the absence of transparent functionality documentation. The combination of obfuscation, hidden payload execution, and claimed data exfiltration capabilities strongly suggests malicious intent."
