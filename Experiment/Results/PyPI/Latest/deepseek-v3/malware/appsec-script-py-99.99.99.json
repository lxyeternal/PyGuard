      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it collects sensitive system information (such as system configuration, current working directory, IP configurations, and public IP) and exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL without user consent. The data collection and exfiltration occur during the package installation process, leveraging a custom install class (CustomInstall) to execute the malicious code silently. The Slack webhook URL (https://hooks.slack.com/services/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) is hardcoded, indicating an external endpoint controlled by an attacker for data exfiltration. This behavior is consistent with information-stealing malware targeting multiple platforms (darwin, linux, win32). There is no legitimate reason for a package setup script to collect and transmit such system information."
