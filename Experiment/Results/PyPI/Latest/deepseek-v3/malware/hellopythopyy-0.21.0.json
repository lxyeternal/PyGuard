      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes suspicious behavior during package installation by downloading an executable (putty.exe) from a remote URL and executing it without user consent. Specifically, it defines a custom PostInstallCommand class that runs the malicious send() function after installation. The send() function downloads putty.exe using the requests library and executes it via os.system. This behavior is typical of supply chain attacks where malicious packages execute unauthorized actions during installation."
