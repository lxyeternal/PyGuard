      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes arbitrary code during package installation by importing and running 'main' from a module named 'main'. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks because it allows malicious code to be executed automatically when the package is installed, without user knowledge or consent. The absence of transparent documentation or notification about this execution, combined with the use of installation hooks for code execution, strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the package requires 'requests' and 'psutil', which are commonly used in malicious scripts for network communication and system monitoring, respectively. The package metadata (name 'huggingface_hubs') suggests potential typosquatting of the legitimate 'huggingface_hub' package, further increasing suspicion of malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple characteristics of malicious behavior, including:\n\n1. Collection of sensitive system information such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses (obtained via system commands).\n\n2. Base64 encoding of collected MAC addresses, suggesting an attempt to obfuscate the data before transmission.\n\n3. Hardcoded suspicious URLs (e.g., domains like 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun') which appear to be attacker-controlled domains for data exfiltration.\n\n4. Automated exfiltration of collected data via HTTP GET requests to these remote URLs without any user notification or consent.\n\n5. Use of broad exception handling to silently suppress any errors that may occur during the exfiltration process, indicating an attempt to remain undetected.\n\n6. Combining system reconnaissance (collecting MAC addresses, hostname, etc.) with immediate network exfiltration to multiple hardcoded endpoints, a hallmark of information-stealing malware.\n\n7. No legitimate purpose or user-facing functionality is provided by the code, reinforcing its malicious nature."
