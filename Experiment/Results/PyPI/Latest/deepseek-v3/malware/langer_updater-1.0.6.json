      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by executing arbitrary code during the package installation process using a custom install class (LangInstall). The 'test' function loads and executes a module from a ZIP file ('my.zip') without any user interaction or consent, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. This behavior is consistent with malware that aims to execute payloads stealthily during installation. The use of zipimport and importlib.util to dynamically load and execute code further underscores the malicious intent, as it obfuscates the code's true purpose and avoids static analysis."
