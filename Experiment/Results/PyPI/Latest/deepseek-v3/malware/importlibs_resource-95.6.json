      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes code upon package installation by invoking a main() function from a module 'main' without user consent. This is a typical supply chain attack vector where malicious payloads are executed during installation without the user's knowledge. The setup includes additional suspicious indicators such as vague metadata (author, description, etc.), and installation dependencies ('requests', 'psutil') which are commonly used in malicious code for network communication and system monitoring. The pattern of executing code during installation via a custom install class is consistently associated with malware and poses a risk of arbitrary code execution."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior, including: 1) Collection of sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses); 2) Encoding collected data (base64); 3) Exfiltration of the collected data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious URLs (e.g., 'http://dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com'); 4) Use of broad exception handling to suppress errors and continue execution silently; 5) No user notification or consent for data collection and transmission."
