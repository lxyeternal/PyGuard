      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that overrides the standard 'install' command from setuptools. During installation, it imports and executes a function 'main' from a module 'main'. This behavior is highly suspicious as it executes arbitrary code during package installation without user consent or clear indication of the code's purpose. The setup.py file lacks legitimate package setup logic, and the primary purpose of the install hook appears to be code execution, which is a common technique in supply chain attacks to achieve persistence or execute malicious payloads automatically upon installation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and transmits it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs without user consent. This behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware. The URLs (e.g., domains containing 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com' and 'oast.fun') are typical of malicious command-and-control servers used in data exfiltration. The combination of system reconnaissance and unsolicited network communication to attacker-controlled domains is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
