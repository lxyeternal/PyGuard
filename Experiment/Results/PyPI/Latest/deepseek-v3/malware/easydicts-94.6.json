      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that overrides the default install behavior to execute additional code during package installation. This is a hallmark of supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed automatically upon installation without user awareness. The setup.py script imports 'main' from a module named 'main' and executes it during installation, which suggests arbitrary code execution is triggered during the installation process. Additionally, the dependencies 'requests' and 'psutil' are required, which are often used in malicious code for network communication and system monitoring, respectively. There is no documented legitimate purpose for executing additional code during installation in this manner, making this behavior highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. This data is then encoded in base64 and exfiltrated to multiple hardcoded suspicious URLs. The use of random identifiers and base64 encoding suggests an attempt to obfuscate the data being sent. The URLs (dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oqvignkp58-psl.i18n.oast-row.byted-dast.com, sbfwstspuutiarcjzptf3c0cvb6yng6mw.oast.fun) appear to be associated with malicious domains, likely acting as command and control servers or data collection points. The code also suppresses all exceptions, which is a common tactic to hide network communication failures. This behavior aligns with typical information-stealing malware that collects and exfiltrates system data without user consent."
