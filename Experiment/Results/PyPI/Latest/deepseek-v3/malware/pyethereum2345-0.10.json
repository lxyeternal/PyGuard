      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It includes a custom install class ('CustomInstall') that performs unauthorized data collection and exfiltration during package installation. Specifically, it collects the hostname, current working directory (via a potentially malicious 'curl' command), and username, then transmits this information to a remote server ('https://eojs8k35b24avi1.m.pipedream.net') without user consent. This behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware and supply chain attacks, where sensitive system data is exfiltrated to attacker-controlled infrastructure."
