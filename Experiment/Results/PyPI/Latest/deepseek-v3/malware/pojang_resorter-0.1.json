      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior by capturing a screenshot of the user's screen without consent and exfiltrating it to a Discord webhook during package installation. The malicious actions are triggered via a custom install command in the setup.py file, which runs automatically upon package installation. The code also includes network communication (requests.post) to send the screenshot to an external server (Discord webhook) and installs required packages (Pillow, requests) silently. This behavior is typical of information-stealing malware and poses a significant privacy and security risk."
