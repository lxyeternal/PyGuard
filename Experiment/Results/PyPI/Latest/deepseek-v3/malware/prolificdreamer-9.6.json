      "malicious_behavior": "The code sets up a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes code from a 'main' module during the package installation process. This pattern is a hallmark of malicious supply chain attacks, as it allows arbitrary code execution upon package installation without user awareness. The code lacks transparency regarding the purpose of the 'main' function, and the setup suggests it will execute potentially harmful actions during installation (e.g., data exfiltration, remote code execution). The usage of 'requests' and 'psutil' in the dependencies further raises suspicion, as these libraries are often used in malicious code for network communication and system reconnaissance respectively."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses) and exfiltrates this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs. The collected MAC addresses are encoded in base64 before transmission, which is a common technique to obfuscate data in malicious code. The code attempts to contact several domains that appear to be attacker-controlled (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun'), which are typical of command and control (C2) servers or data exfiltration endpoints used in malware. The communication occurs without user consent or notification, and the code suppresses all errors (broad try/except blocks), which is a common evasion technique in malicious software. The combination of unauthorized data collection, obfuscation, and exfiltration to suspicious domains strongly indicates malicious intent."
