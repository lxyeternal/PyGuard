      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom install class 'PreferredSettings' that downloads a file from a remote URL ('https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb') during package installation. The downloaded content is written to '~/.fleetwood.py', and the code attempts to modify shell configuration files ('~/.zshrc' and '~/.bash_profile') to automatically execute this file on shell startup. This behavior constitutes unauthorized remote code execution and persistence mechanisms, hallmark traits of malware. Additionally, the code suppresses all exceptions with broad try/except blocks, hiding potential errors from the user. These actions are performed without user consent or notification, further indicating malicious intent."
