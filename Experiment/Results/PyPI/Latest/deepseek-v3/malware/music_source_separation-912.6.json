      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes additional code during package installation by importing and running a function 'main' from a module 'main'. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation without user awareness or consent. The use of 'requests' in 'install_requires' suggests potential network communication or data exfiltration capabilities. This pattern is consistently associated with malware and is not observed in benign software, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior: 1) It collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) without user consent or notification. 2) It transmits this collected data to multiple hardcoded external URLs that appear to be attacker-controlled domains (oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast-row.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). 3) The domains in the URLs appear to be related to Out-of-band Application Security Testing (OAST) services often used by attackers for callback verification. 4) The data transmission is performed automatically without any user interaction or legitimate purpose. 5) The code attempts to contact multiple endpoints, likely for redundancy in case some are blocked. 6) The random number generation (rd_num) could be used to avoid simple pattern detection. 7) The code suppresses all errors with a generic exception handler, which is common in malicious code to avoid detection."
