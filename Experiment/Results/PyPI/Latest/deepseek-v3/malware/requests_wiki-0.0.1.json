      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple indicators of malicious behavior, including: 1) Collection of sensitive system information such as hostname, IP address, username, platform details, and public IP along with geographical location; 2) Attempt to send collected data to a hardcoded remote server (http://38.181.219.70:5000/report) without user consent, which is a strong indicator of data exfiltration; 3) Execution of data collection and transmission automatically upon package installation, leveraging setuptools setup to run malicious code during installation (supply chain attack vector); 4) Use of misleading package metadata (name 'requests-wiki') and description ('for research purposes') to disguise malicious intent; 5) No user notification or consent obtained for the collection and transmission of sensitive data. These behaviors align with typical characteristics of malware, specifically information-stealing and remote access trojans (RATs)."
