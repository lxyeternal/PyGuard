      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior in the form of unauthorized data exfiltration during package installation. Specifically, it collects system information including the hostname, operating system, and public IP address via the platform module and external API (api.ipify.org). Subsequently, it sends this data to an external attacker-controlled webhook (webhook.site) without user consent or knowledge. This behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware and represents a clear violation of user privacy and system security. Additionally, the use of installation hooks to execute this unauthorized data collection provides further evidence of malicious intent, as legitimate packages typically do not perform such remote communications during installation."
