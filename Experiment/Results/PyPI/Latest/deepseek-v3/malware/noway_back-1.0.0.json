      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior by executing arbitrary code during package installation. Specifically, it defines a custom install class (N) that overrides the run method to execute the test function before running the standard installation. The test function imports and executes code from a zip file (zip.zip) dynamically, which is a common technique for hiding malicious payloads. This behavior is characteristic of supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during the installation process without the user's knowledge. The setup function is configured to use this custom install class, ensuring the malicious code runs whenever the package is installed."
