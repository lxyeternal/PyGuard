      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class (LangInstall) that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute arbitrary code during package installation. This code dynamically loads and executes a module from 'my.zip', which is a suspicious behavior typical of malicious payloads attempting to evade static analysis. The use of zipimport and dynamic module execution without user consent or transparency is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise."
