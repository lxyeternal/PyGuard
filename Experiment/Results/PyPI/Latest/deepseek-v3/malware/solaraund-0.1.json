      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that downloads and executes an external executable file ('CBLines.exe') from a GitHub repository without user consent or notification. This behavior is characteristic of malware, as it enables remote code execution during package installation, a common tactic in supply chain attacks. The use of PowerShell commands to download and execute the file further indicates malicious intent, as it bypasses typical security controls and can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's system. The absence of any legitimate setup logic or transparent purpose for downloading and running the executable strongly suggests that this package is designed to deploy malware."
