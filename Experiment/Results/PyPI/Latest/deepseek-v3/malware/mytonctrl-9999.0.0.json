      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class (CustomInstall) that executes during the package installation process. This class collects sensitive system information (hostname, current working directory, and username) and exfiltrates it to a remote server (https://0no5igfzh7uwsmzmvvr9eyfy6pcg0eo3.oastify.com) without user consent or notification. This behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware, as it involves unauthorized data collection and transmission to an external, potentially attacker-controlled domain. The use of setuptools install hooks for data exfiltration is a common tactic in supply chain attacks and is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
