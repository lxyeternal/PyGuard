      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It makes HTTP requests to a remote server (http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/awsglueml) both during import and post-installation. This behavior is indicative of a potential data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication, which is a hallmark of malicious activity. Additionally, the use of a custom PostInstallCommand class to execute the post-install function ensures that the malicious behavior is triggered automatically upon package installation, which is a common technique in supply chain attacks."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code makes an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external URL ('http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/awsglueml'). Based on the analysis criteria, this behavior is suspicious because: 1) The domain ('pov.sh') appears to be non-standard and could be attacker-controlled. 2) There is no apparent legitimate reason for this network communication. 3) The code lacks user consent or notification for this network activity. 4) The pattern matches known malicious behavior where code communicates with external servers for potential command-and-control or data exfiltration purposes. 5) The URL is hardcoded, which is a common characteristic of malicious code for exfiltration endpoints."
