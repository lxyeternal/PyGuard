      "malicious_behavior": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by using a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes arbitrary code (from main import main; main()) during package installation. This is a classic supply chain attack technique where malicious code is run automatically when the package is installed, without user consent. The pattern is exclusively observed in malware (malware_ratio: 1.0) and is used for unauthorized code execution, data exfiltration, or further compromise of the system. The inclusion of 'requests' in install_requires suggests potential network communication or data exfiltration capabilities."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and exfiltrates this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious URLs without user consent. The URLs appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun'). This behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware that gathers reconnaissance data about infected systems for potential further exploitation. The use of random numbers in the URL path and the lack of legitimate purpose for transmitting this system information reinforce the malicious intent."
