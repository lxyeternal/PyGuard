      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes the 'main' function from a module named 'main' during package installation. This behavior is suspicious as it executes arbitrary code during installation without user consent, which is a common technique used in supply chain attacks to deploy malware. The setup script also requires 'requests' and 'psutil', which could be used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration or system monitoring. The lack of transparency about what the 'main' function does increases the risk of malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior: it collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) without user consent, encodes this information using base64, and exfiltrates it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious URLs. The URLs appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., 'oast.fun', 'byted-dast.com'), which are commonly used for data exfiltration in malware. The code also suppresses all exceptions, hiding any potential errors during exfiltration. Additionally, the use of subprocess calls to gather MAC addresses and the immediate encoding and transmission of collected data align with typical information-stealing malware behaviors."
