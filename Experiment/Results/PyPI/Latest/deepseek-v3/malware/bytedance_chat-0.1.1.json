      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior. It uses base64 encoding to obfuscate a URL, which is then concatenated with the hostname of the machine. This URL is then used to make an HTTPS request with SSL certificate verification disabled (potential man-in-the-middle risk). The combination of obfuscating the URL, dynamically constructing it with the hostname, and disabling SSL verification suggests an attempt to exfiltrate system information to a remote server without the user's knowledge or consent. Additionally, the lack of any user notification or legitimate purpose for this network communication further supports the classification as malicious."
