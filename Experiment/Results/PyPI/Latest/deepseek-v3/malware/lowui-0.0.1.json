This behavior is indicative of malware, as it involves downloading and running an unknown executable, which could perform malicious actions such as data theft, remote control, or further malware deployment. The use of PowerShell to download and execute the file silently (with -NoNewWindow -Wait) is a common technique to evade detection and suppress any visible output, further suggesting malicious intent."

This behavior is indicative of a classic malware download-and-execute pattern, commonly used in malware to deliver malicious payloads. The use of subprocess to run PowerShell commands for downloading and executing files is a strong indicator of malicious intent, especially when combined with the silent execution (-NoNewWindow -Wait). The remote repository (github.com/holdthatcode/e) is not a trusted or well-known source, further increasing the risk associated with this code."
