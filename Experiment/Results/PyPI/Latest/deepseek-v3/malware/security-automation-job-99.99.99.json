      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class that runs during package installation. It collects sensitive system information (such as system configuration, current working directory, IP configuration, and public IP) across different platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows) and sends this data to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL without user consent. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration, a common malicious activity. The use of installation hooks for unauthorized data collection and transmission is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware."
