      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' within the setup.py file, which executes a function 'main()' from a module 'main' during the package installation process. This behavior is typical of malicious code that abuses setuptools installation hooks to perform unauthorized actions during package installation without user consent. The package also specifies 'requests' as a required dependency, which could be used for network communication or data exfiltration. The setup appears benign at surface level but contains hidden malicious execution triggered during installation, a common tactic in supply chain attacks."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple characteristics of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) without user consent and exfiltrates this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs. The domains used (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com001', 'oast.fun') appear to be attacker-controlled infrastructure commonly used in malware for data exfiltration. The code attempts to connect to these URLs and transmits the collected data as URL parameters. This behavior aligns with information-stealing malware and unauthorized data exfiltration patterns. The use of random numbers in the URL path and the lack of legitimate purpose for this data collection further confirm the malicious intent."
