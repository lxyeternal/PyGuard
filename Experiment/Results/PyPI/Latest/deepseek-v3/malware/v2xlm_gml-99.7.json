      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes arbitrary code (main() function from main module) during package installation. This is a classic malicious supply chain attack pattern, where malicious payloads are executed automatically without user knowledge during installation. The setup.py requires 'requests' which could be used for data exfiltration. There is no legitimate reason for a package to execute custom code during installation this way, making this a strong indicator of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior, including collecting sensitive system information (hostname, username, current directory path) and attempting to exfiltrate this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs. The URLs appear to be dynamically generated with random numbers and query parameters, which is a common technique for evading detection. The code does not provide any user notification or consent for data collection and transmission, and the remote endpoints it communicates with resemble attacker-controlled domains (e.g., domains containing 'oast' and 'byted-dast'). These actions align with typical malware behaviors such as information theft and unauthorized data exfiltration to remote command-and-control servers."
