      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it exfiltrates sensitive system information (hostname, current working directory, username) to a remote server during package installation. This behavior is triggered automatically without user consent when the package is installed, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of the requests library to send data to an external domain (oastify.com) clearly indicates data exfiltration without proper disclosure or user consent. Additionally, the setup configuration lacks legitimate package setup logic, suggesting that the primary purpose of the package is to execute malicious code rather than provide any legitimate functionality."
