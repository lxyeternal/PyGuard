      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class (`CustomInstall`) that collects sensitive system information (hostname, current working directory, username, and output of the 'ls' command) and exfiltrates this data to a remote server via HTTP POST request (http://192.198.82.14:3000/log). This behavior is characteristic of data exfiltration malware and violates user privacy by transmitting sensitive system information without consent. The use of installation hooks (`setuptools.command.install.install`) to execute this malicious logic during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks."
