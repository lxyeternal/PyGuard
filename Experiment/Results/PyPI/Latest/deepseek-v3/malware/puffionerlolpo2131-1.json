      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a malicious payload embedded in the setup.py script. It defines a custom_command function that retrieves an access token from Google Cloud metadata service using HTTP requests with a specific service account. The retrieved token is then sent via POST request to an external webhook site (https://webhook.site/) with a hardcoded UUID identifier. This behavior indicates credential theft and unauthorized data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled endpoint. The malicious command is integrated into the package installation process by overriding standard setuptools commands (install, develop, egg_info), ensuring the payload executes whenever the package is installed."
