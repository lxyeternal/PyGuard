      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom PostInstallCommand class that executes during package installation. This class contains obfuscated strings and attempts to run shell commands designed to download and execute a remote script from a GitHub repository (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoneroOcean/xmrig_setup/master/setup_moneroocean_miner.sh). The code uses subprocess.run to execute these commands silently (suppressing stdout and stderr). This behavior is characteristic of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed during package installation without user knowledge or consent. The use of obfuscated strings (via chr() function concatenation) and direct execution of downloaded scripts are strong indicators of malicious intent, specifically designed to deploy a cryptocurrency miner (MoneroOcean miner) on the victim's system."
