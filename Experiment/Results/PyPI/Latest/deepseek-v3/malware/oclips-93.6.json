      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes arbitrary code (from main import main, main()) during package installation. This is a strong indicator of malware, as it enables remote code execution without user knowledge or consent. The pattern of using setuptools install hooks to execute arbitrary code is malicious and consistent with supply chain attacks. The inclusion of requests and psutil as dependencies further suggests potential for data collection and exfiltration."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious behavior, including: 1) Collection of sensitive system information (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses), 2) Encoding of collected data (base64 encoding of MAC addresses), 3) Attempted exfiltration of this data to multiple suspicious external domains ('dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oqvignkp58-psl.i18n.oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'sbfwstspuutiarcjzptf3c0cvb6yng6mw.oast.fun') via HTTP requests, 4) Use of random numbers in the URL path likely for evasion, 5) Broad exception handling to suppress errors and continue execution silently. These behaviors are characteristic of information-stealing malware designed to gather and exfiltrate system fingerprinting data to attacker-controlled infrastructure."
