      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains malicious behavior. Specifically, it defines a custom PostInstallCommand class that inherits from setuptools command.install. This class is designed to execute arbitrary commands during the package installation process. The malicious behavior includes collecting sensitive system information such as hostname, current user, and network configuration (via ifconfig) and writing this data to a temporary file (/tmp/r). Additionally, the code attempts to exfiltrate this collected data by making an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded IP address (61.28.229.27) without any user consent. Such behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware and poses a significant security risk by potentially leaking sensitive system information to an attacker-controlled server."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior where it collects system information (hostname, user information, and IP configuration) via subprocess calls and then exfiltrates this data to an external server ('http://61.28.229.27') using POST requests. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration and poses a significant privacy and security risk. The malicious actions are embedded within the initialization of the EOSIOKey class, which suggests that the malicious code executes whenever an instance of this class is created."
