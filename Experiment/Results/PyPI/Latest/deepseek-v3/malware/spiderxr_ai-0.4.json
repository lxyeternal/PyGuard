Key indicators include: 1) Hardcoded Telegram bot token (`7312059616:AAH5VdNSh9TQ9OsnPXF8pcmR1fIjEFe6NJg`) and chat ID (`7265766559`) used to exfiltrate collected data without user consent; 2) Collection and transmission of sensitive IP information (location, ISP, coordinates) to a remote Telegram chat controlled by the attacker; 3) Communication with suspicious hardcoded IP addresses (`104.236.72.47:8909`, `104.236.72.47:4556`) for executing remote commands (via `Devils_GPT` and `Worm_GPT` functions); 4) Use of obfuscated headers and network communications to disguise malicious traffic; 5) Lack of user notification or consent for data collection and transmission."
