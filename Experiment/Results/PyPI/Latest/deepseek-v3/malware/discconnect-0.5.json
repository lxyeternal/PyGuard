      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior: 1) It downloads an executable file from a remote URL during installation (https://filetransfer.io/data-package/MG85ggQt/download) without user consent. 2) It saves the downloaded file to the user's LOCALAPPDATA directory with the name 'Driver.exe', which could be misleading. 3) It attempts to execute the downloaded file immediately after installation using ShellExecuteW on Windows systems. 4) The custom install command is designed to run automatically during package installation, enabling silent execution of malicious payloads. 5) The behavior is hidden within the package installation process, a common technique used in supply chain attacks. These characteristics are consistent with malware downloaders and droppers that fetch and execute additional payloads."
