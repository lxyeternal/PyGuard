      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes additional code during package installation by importing and running a function 'm' from 'main' module. This behavior is typical of supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation without user awareness. The setup configuration includes 'requests' and 'psutil' as dependencies, which are common in malware for network communication and system information gathering. The use of a custom install hook to execute arbitrary code is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables unauthorized code execution and potential data exfiltration or system compromise."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious behavior: 1) It collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses (via g_m_a function); 2) The collected data is exfiltrated to multiple hardcoded URLs that have been base64-encoded to obscure their true destination; 3) The URLs appear to be attacker-controlled domains based on their naming patterns (byte-dast.com domain variations); 4) The code uses broad exception handling to suppress errors and silently continue execution; 5) Network communication is performed without user consent or notification; 6) MAC addresses are gathered specifically for both Windows and Linux/Mac systems indicating intentional cross-platform targeting; 7) Random numbers are generated as part of the URL construction possibly for evasion purposes. These behaviors collectively indicate information stealing malware designed to gather and exfiltrate system fingerprinting data to attacker-controlled servers."
