      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior: 1. It collects the current username without user consent. 2. It executes commands (specifically 'ls -alh /run/secrets/') to list sensitive directory contents. 3. It encodes the command output in base64 and exfiltrates it to a remote server (blackwolf.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com) via an HTTP PUT request. 4. It employs a custom install class (CustomInstall) to automatically execute malicious code during package installation, which is a common technique in supply chain attacks. 5. Conditional execution based on username ('modelarts') attempts to hide its behavior in certain environments. These actions collectively indicate unauthorized data collection, command execution, and exfiltration to an external server."
