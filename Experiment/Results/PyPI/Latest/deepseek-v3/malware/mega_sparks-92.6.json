      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes 'main.main()' immediately after package installation without user consent. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, where malicious code is executed during package installation. The setup includes 'requests' and 'psutil' as dependencies, which are commonly used in malware for network communication and system information gathering. The lack of transparency regarding the purpose of the executed main function and the absence of user notification or consent strongly indicate malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior, including: 1. Collecting sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) without user consent. 2. Encoding the collected data (MAC addresses) with base64 for potential obfuscation. 3. Attempting to exfiltrate the collected data to multiple hardcoded suspicious URLs (e.g., 'dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com') via HTTP requests. 4. Using broad exception handling to suppress errors and ensure silent execution. 5. The domains used for exfiltration appear to be dynamically generated or suspicious (e.g., 'oast.fun'), which is a common technique in malware to evade detection. This behavior is consistent with information-stealing malware and unauthorized data exfiltration."
