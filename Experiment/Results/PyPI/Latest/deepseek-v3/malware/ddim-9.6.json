      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes arbitrary code (from main import main) during package installation. This is a common tactic in malicious Python packages to achieve persistence and unauthorized code execution. The setup requires 'requests' and 'psutil', which could be used for data exfiltration and system monitoring. The lack of transparency about what code is executed (import from 'main') and the absence of user notification or consent during installation are strong indicators of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses) and exfiltrates this data to multiple external URLs without user consent. The data is encoded in base64 and sent via HTTP requests. The URLs appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., 'dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oqvignkp58-psl.i18n.oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'sbfwstspuutiarcjzptf0rueg2x53eh2c.oast.fun'), which are indicative of command and control (C2) infrastructure. The code also suppresses all exceptions to avoid detection and ensure silent execution. This behavior is typical of information-stealing malware and poses a significant risk to user privacy and system security."
