      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior where it collects sensitive system information (hostname, current working directory, username) during package installation and exfiltrates this data to an external, attacker-controlled server (https://468dsoou932zmzkp79cjaogzzq5ht9hy.oastify.com) via HTTP GET requests. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where the attacker abuses the package installation process to steal data without the user's knowledge or consent. The use of setuptools.command.install to execute malicious code during installation is a common technique in malicious Python packages."
