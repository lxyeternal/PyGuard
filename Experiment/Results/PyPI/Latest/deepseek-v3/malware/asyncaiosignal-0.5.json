The data is then exfiltrated via Telegram. The code also attempts to disable SSL verification (ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context) and includes mechanisms for persistence (Autostart).

Additionally, the code exits silently upon detecting specific conditions, which is a tactic to prevent further inspection or reverse engineering. The use of system and process checks combined with network communications (though suppressed in the provided code) further supports the classification as malicious, aiming to collect and potentially exfiltrate system information."

It collects system information (username via getuser()), packages it into an encrypted ZIP file, and sends it via SMTP to a hardcoded recipient without user consent. The code suppresses all exceptions (broad try/except block), hides its actions via the __send_archive method, and uses SMTP credentials directly (indicating unauthorized data exfiltration). The combination of data collection, encryption, and unauthorized transmission is a hallmark of malware."

The class Discord is initialized with a webhook URL, and the __send_archive method uses this webhook to send data collected and encoded by __get_sender_data. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL (self.__webhook) and the silent exception handling (broad except block without logging or user notification) are strong indicators of malicious intent. Additionally, the method _create_unverified_https suggests an attempt to bypass SSL verification, which is a common technique in malware to avoid detection. This behavior aligns with typical characteristics of malware involving data exfiltration and unauthorized network communication."
