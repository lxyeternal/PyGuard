      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it involves data exfiltration to an external Telegram bot. The script prompts the user to input 12 seed phrases (typically sensitive cryptographic key material) and immediately sends them to a hardcoded Telegram bot token (8161179896:AAETIZWLz-kWOTPCX3OPs_s9xHjgKzh6PL4) and chat ID (6041976324). This behavior matches criteria for credential theft and unauthorized data exfiltration, as the code does not provide any legitimate reason for collecting or transmitting these seed phrases. Furthermore, the presence of hardcoded bot credentials and automated transmission of sensitive data without user consent or security safeguards are hallmarks of malicious intent."
