      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that extends setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to execute a function 'main' from a module 'main' immediately after package installation. This behavior is a hallmark of malicious Python packages that abuse installation hooks to execute arbitrary code during package installation without user consent. The pattern is commonly used in supply chain attacks to deploy malware, exfiltrate data, or achieve persistence. The setup requires 'requests', which may be used for network communication (e.g., data exfiltration or payload download). The lack of transparency about what 'main()' does and the absence of legitimate package setup logic further indicate malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits clear signs of malicious behavior by collecting sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) without user consent or notification and then exfiltrating this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external domains via HTTP requests. This behavior is typical of information-stealing malware or reconnaissance tools used in cyber attacks. The use of obfuscation (random number appended to URL paths) and multiple attacker-controlled domains (sbfwstspuutiarcjzptfenn9u0dsxhjlu.oast.fun and similar) further confirms the malicious intent. The code lacks any legitimate purpose for transmitting this data externally and operates covertly without user interaction, which aligns with common malware patterns."
