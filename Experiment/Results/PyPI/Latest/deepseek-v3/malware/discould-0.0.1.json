This behavior is characteristic of malware, as it involves downloading and running an external executable without user consent or verification of the file's integrity or purpose. The execution is done silently ('-NoNewWindow -Wait'), which is a common tactic to avoid detection and user interaction. The combination of downloading and executing arbitrary binaries from external sources is a strong indicator of malicious intent, potentially leading to further compromise of the system."

This behavior is indicative of a malicious payload delivery mechanism, as it involves downloading and running an external executable without user consent or verification. The use of PowerShell to execute the downloaded file silently (Start-Process with -NoNewWindow and -Wait flags) further suggests an attempt to evade detection. The combination of downloading an executable from an external source and executing it without user interaction is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
