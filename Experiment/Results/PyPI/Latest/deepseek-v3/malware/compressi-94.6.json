      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes an arbitrary function 'main' from 'main.py' during package installation. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically during package installation. The use of an installation hook to run arbitrary code without user consent is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the package requires 'requests' and 'psutil', which are commonly used in malicious code for network communication and system information gathering, further supporting the classification of this code as malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and then sends this data to multiple hardcoded external URLs without user consent. This behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware, as it performs unauthorized data collection and exfiltration to potentially malicious endpoints. The presence of obfuscation (base64 encoding of MAC addresses), attempts to hide errors with broad try/except blocks, and lack of user notification or consent further confirm its malicious intent."
