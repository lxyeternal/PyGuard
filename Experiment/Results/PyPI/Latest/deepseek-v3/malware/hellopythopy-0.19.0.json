      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it downloads and executes an executable file during the package installation process without user consent. Specifically, it defines a function 'send()' that downloads a file named 'putty.exe' from a remote URL and saves it as 'ins42.exe' locally, then executes it using 'os.system'. This behavior is encapsulated in a custom 'PostInstallCommand' class that runs during the package installation phase, which is a common technique for supply chain attacks. The combination of downloading and executing an external executable automatically during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
