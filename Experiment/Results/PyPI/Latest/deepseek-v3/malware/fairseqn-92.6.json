      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that overrides the standard 'install.run' method from setuptools. This class executes the 'main' function from an imported module 'main' (undefined in the provided code). This pattern is a hallmark of malicious Python packages that execute arbitrary code during installation, without user consent. The suspicious behavior includes executing code at install time via setup.py, which is commonly used in supply chain attacks to distribute malware. The package also requires 'requests' and 'psutil', which are suspicious because they are network and system monitoring libraries often used in malicious activities like data exfiltration and system reconnaissance. Combined with the lack of transparency about what the 'main' function does, this strongly indicates malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses) without user consent. The collected data is then encoded in base64 and exfiltrated to multiple hardcoded, suspicious URLs (e.g., 'http://dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com'). The use of random numbers in the URL and broad exception handling (suppressing all errors) further indicates attempts to evade detection and ensure successful data exfiltration. This behavior is consistent with information-stealing malware, which collects and transmits system data to attacker-controlled servers for malicious purposes."
