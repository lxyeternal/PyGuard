      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior, including the use of obfuscation techniques to hide its true intent, dynamically constructing a command to download and execute arbitrary code from a remote server, and executing it via the eval function without user consent. The specific malicious actions include: 1) Using binascii to encode and decode strings in an attempt to obscure the malicious payload. 2) Constructing a command string (chicken) that, when decoded, forms a curl command to download and execute a file from a remote server (34.208.246.227:33791/index.html). 3) Using eval to execute the dynamically constructed command, which could potentially download and execute arbitrary malicious code on the victim's machine. These actions are typical of malicious scripts designed to evade detection and perform unauthorized operations."
