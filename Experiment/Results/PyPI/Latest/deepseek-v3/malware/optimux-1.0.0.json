      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install command that executes a curl command post-installation, which collects and exfiltrates sensitive system information (whoami, hostname, pwd, and IP) to a remote server (https://enj2782rxwxl.x.pipedream.net/) without user consent. This behavior is characteristic of malware, as it involves unauthorized data collection and exfiltration to an external, attacker-controlled endpoint. The use of setuptools installation hooks for executing such commands is a common technique in supply chain attacks."
