Additionally, the package requires 'requests', which could be used for network communication, potentially for data exfiltration or other malicious activities. The presence of a description that acknowledges the package's use for malware building is a strong indicator of malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics indicative of malicious behavior: 1) It downloads a Python script from a hardcoded URL (https://blockatlaspro.com/test.py) without user consent or notification. 2) It saves the downloaded script to a hidden directory in the user's AppData folder (~/AppData/Local/App) using a randomly generated filename (temp_script_<uuid>.py). 3) It sets the file attribute to hidden (SetFileAttributesW with flag 2) to evade detection. 4) It executes the downloaded script using subprocess.Popen with output and error streams redirected to DEVNULL to suppress any visible output. 5) The execution occurs automatically when a specific file (src/task_manager.py) is found, without any user interaction. These behaviors are consistent with malware that downloads and executes arbitrary code from a remote server, potentially leading to further compromise of the system."
