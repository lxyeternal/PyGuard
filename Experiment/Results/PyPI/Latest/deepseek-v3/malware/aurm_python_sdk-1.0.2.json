This behavior includes downloading a file from a remote URL (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) and writing it to the user's home directory as ~/.fleetwood.py. Additionally, it attempts to modify shell configuration files (.zshrc and .bash_profile) to execute the downloaded script automatically upon shell startup. This constitutes unauthorized remote code execution and persistence mechanisms, which are typical of malicious behavior. Such actions are executed without user consent or notification, further confirming the malicious intent."
