      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class 'PreferredSettings' that downloads a file from a remote URL during installation and writes it to the user's home directory as '~/.fleetwood.py'. It then attempts to modify the user's shell configuration files (.zshrc and .bash_profile) to execute this downloaded script automatically upon shell startup. This behavior is indicative of a persistence mechanism commonly used in malware to maintain access to a compromised system. The download and execution of remote code without explicit user consent is a hallmark of malicious activity. Furthermore, the code suppresses all exceptions, hiding any errors that might alert the user to these actions."
