      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class that executes malicious behavior during package installation. It checks if the operating system is Windows ('nt') and, if true, imports 'requests' and uses Fernet encryption to decrypt and execute a payload. This payload is obfuscated and likely performs unauthorized actions such as data exfiltration or remote code execution. The package also requires external dependencies ('fernet', 'requests') typically used in malicious code for network communication and encryption. The description and long description are nonsensical and likely used to obfuscate the package's true purpose. The combination of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, and use of install hooks indicates a supply chain attack vector."
