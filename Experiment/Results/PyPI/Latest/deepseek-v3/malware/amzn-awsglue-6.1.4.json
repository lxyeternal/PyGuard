      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom post-installation script that makes HTTP requests to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-awsglue' without user consent or notification. This behavior is atypical for legitimate package installations and suggests potential data exfiltration or callback to a malicious server. The use of setuptools command override to execute network requests during installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, enabling unauthorized remote communication during package setup."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports the 'requests' library and makes an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded domain (pov.sh:45111) without any user notification or consent. This behavior is indicative of potential data exfiltration or unauthorized communication with a remote server. The presence of a hardcoded, non-standard domain in the code increases suspicion, as it resembles patterns commonly observed in malware for command and control (C2) or data exfiltration purposes."
