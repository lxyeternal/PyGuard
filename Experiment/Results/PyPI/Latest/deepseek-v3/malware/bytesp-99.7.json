      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class `CrazyInstallStrat` that executes code from an imported `main` module during package installation. This behavior is characteristic of malicious Python packages that perform unwanted actions during installation, such as executing arbitrary code, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The use of a custom install hook (`cmdclass`) to run external code without user consent is a strong indicator of malicious intent, commonly observed in supply chain attacks. The package also requires the 'requests' library, which could be used for network communication, further raising suspicion of potential data exfiltration."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and exfiltrates it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs without user consent. The URLs (e.g., 'dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com') appear to be dynamically generated command and control (C2) domains, commonly used in malware for data exfiltration. The use of random numbers in the URL path and URL encoding of parameters is an attempt to evade detection. The combination of system information gathering and unsolicited network communication to suspicious domains is a strong indicator of malicious intent, classifying this as an information-stealing malware sample."
