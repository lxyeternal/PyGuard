      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes custom installation logic via the 'CrazyInstallStrat' class, which runs an imported 'main' function during package installation. This is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation without user consent. The setup.py file lacks legitimate package setup logic and instead focuses on executing arbitrary code (via 'main') during installation. The inclusion of 'requests' and 'psutil' in install_requires suggests potential network communication or system monitoring capabilities, further indicating malicious intent. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware and is never present in benign software, as it enables remote code execution, data exfiltration, and further malware deployment without user awareness."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) without user consent. It then encodes this information (using base64) and attempts to exfiltrate it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious remote URLs (including domains like 'oast.fun' and 'byted-dast.com' which are associated with malware). The code suppresses all errors during the exfiltration attempts, which is a common evasion technique in malware. The combination of system information gathering, encoding, and unsolicited network communication to attacker-controlled endpoints is a hallmark of information-stealing malware."
