      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it makes HTTP requests to a suspicious external domain ('http://pov.sh') during package installation. Specifically, it sends a GET request to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-aws-glue-ml-libs-python'. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration or communication with a command and control server. The use of a custom PostInstallCommand to execute this request during the package installation process further confirms the malicious intent, as it ensures the code executes without user knowledge or consent. This pattern is consistent with supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation to compromise systems."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code makes a network request to a potentially suspicious domain 'pov.sh' on port 45111, which is not a standard port for web traffic. The endpoint '/api/v3/amzn-aws-glue-ml-libs-python' suggests potential impersonation or targeting of AWS Glue ML libraries. This behavior aligns with typical malicious patterns involving unsolicited network communication to non-standard domains or ports, potentially for data exfiltration or command and control purposes."
