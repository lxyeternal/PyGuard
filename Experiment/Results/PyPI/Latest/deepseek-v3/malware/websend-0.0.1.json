      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads and executes an external executable file (CBLines.exe) from a GitHub repository without user consent or validation of the file's integrity. This behavior is indicative of a dropper or downloader, which is commonly associated with malware. The executable is run silently using PowerShell's Start-Process with the -NoNewWindow and -Wait flags, which can hide the execution from the user. The combination of downloading an executable from an external source and executing it without user interaction is a strong indicator of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from an external GitHub repository and executes it silently on the system. This behavior is malicious because it involves downloading and running an untrusted binary without user consent. The use of PowerShell to download and execute the file, combined with the silent execution (Start-Process with -NoNewWindow -Wait), is indicative of malware behavior aimed at evading detection and user awareness. Additionally, the lack of verification for the downloaded file's integrity or origin further increases the risk of executing malicious code."
