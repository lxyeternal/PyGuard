      "malicious_behavior": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by utilizing a custom install class (`CrazyInstallStrat`) that executes additional code (`main()`) from an imported module (`main`) during package installation. This pattern is indicative of a supply chain attack, where the attacker leverages the package installation process to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine without their knowledge. The presence of `requests` in the `install_requires` list suggests potential network communication, which could be used for data exfiltration or downloading further malicious payloads. The lack of transparency regarding the purpose of the executed code (`main()`) and the misuse of installation hooks for unintended code execution are strong indicators of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, and current path) and exfiltrates it to multiple hardcoded suspicious domains via HTTP requests. This behavior is indicative of information-stealing malware. The domains (e.g., 'dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com001', 'oqvignkp58-psl.i18n.oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'sbfwstspuutiarcjzptf0rueg2x53eh2c.oast.fun') appear to be dynamically generated or obfuscated (typical of command and control servers). The data collection and exfiltration occur without user consent or notification, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior. Additionally, the use of random numbers (random.randint) combined with URL encoding suggests attempts to evade detection by varying the request parameters."
