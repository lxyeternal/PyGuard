      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install command (PostInstallCommand) that runs a webhook after package installation without user consent. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed during package installation. The webhook call (send_to_webhook) could be used for data exfiltration, remote code execution, or other malicious activities. The setup.py also includes an entry_point for console_scripts, which could further execute malicious code. The lack of transparency about the webhook's purpose and the automatic execution during installation are strong indicators of malicious intent."

This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled endpoint, which is a common malicious activity. The use of hardcoded URLs and unsolicited network communication are strong indicators of malicious intent."
