      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes arbitrary code during package installation by importing and running a function called `main` from a module named `main`. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation without user consent. The package also requires `requests` and `psutil`, which are commonly used in malicious code for network communication and system monitoring/exfiltration. The setup lacks transparency about its purpose (author, description, and email are generic or anonymous), and the install hook's primary purpose is executing hidden code rather than legitimate package setup logic."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several indicators of malicious behavior, including: 1) Collection of sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) without user consent; 2) Encoding of collected data using base64 for obfuscation; 3) Communication with hardcoded, suspicious external domains (oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast-row.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) which appear to be attacker-controlled infrastructure; 4) The domains follow patterns consistent with DNS exfiltration (oast domains are commonly used in Out-of-band Application Security Testing tools for command and control); 5) Use of random numbers in URLs to potentially evade simple detection; 6) Broad exception handling to suppress errors and continue execution silently; 7) The entire behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration from the system to remote attackers."
