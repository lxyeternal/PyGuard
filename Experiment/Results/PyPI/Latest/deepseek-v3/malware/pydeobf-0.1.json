This behavior is malicious because it involves downloading and executing arbitrary code without user consent, which is a common technique used in malware for payload delivery and execution. The use of PowerShell commands ('Invoke-WebRequest' and 'Start-Process') to download and run the executable further exacerbates the risk, as it can bypass certain security controls. Additionally, the lack of transparency regarding the purpose of the downloaded executable and its execution during installation strongly indicates malicious intent."
