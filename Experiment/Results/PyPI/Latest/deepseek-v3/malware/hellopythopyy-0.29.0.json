      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes malicious behavior by downloading and running an executable file (putty.exe) from a remote URL during package installation. The behavior is triggered via a custom install class (PostInstallCommand) that runs the malicious send() function post-installation. The send() function downloads the executable from 'https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/putty.exe', saves it as 'ins42.exe', and executes it using os.system('start ' + filename). This constitutes a supply chain attack, as the malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation without user consent or awareness. The actions include unauthorized download and execution of potentially harmful executables, which is a hallmark of malware."
