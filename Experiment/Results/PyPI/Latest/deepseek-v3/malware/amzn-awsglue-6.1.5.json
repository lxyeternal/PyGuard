      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom post-installation command that makes HTTP requests to a hardcoded external URL ('http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-awsglue') without user consent or notification. This behavior is indicative of potential data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication, which is a hallmark of malicious activity. The use of network requests in installation hooks is highly suspicious and not required for legitimate package functionality. Additionally, the code lacks transparency regarding the purpose of these requests, further supporting the classification as malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code makes a GET request to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-awsglue'. The domain 'pov.sh' is not a known or standard domain for legitimate AWS Glue services, and the use of a non-standard port (45111) is atypical for benign API communications. This behavior aligns with indicators of malicious activity, such as unauthorized network communication, potential data exfiltration, or checking into a command-and-control server. Obfuscation or lack of transparency regarding the purpose of network communication further supports the malicious classification."
