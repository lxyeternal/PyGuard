This behavior is characteristic of malware payload delivery, as it involves downloading and executing arbitrary code from an external source without user consent or validation. The use of hardcoded URLs, subprocess execution, and silent execution flags (-NoNewWindow) are common tactics in malicious scripts to evade detection and perform unauthorized actions on the host system."
