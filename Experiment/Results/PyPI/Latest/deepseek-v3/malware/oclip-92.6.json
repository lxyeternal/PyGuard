      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes code from an imported 'main' module during the package installation process. This is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, where malicious code is executed automatically during package installation without user awareness. The behavior enables remote code execution, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. The use of network and system monitoring libraries (requests, psutil) in the install_requires list further supports the suspicion of malicious intent, as these could be used for unauthorized data collection and exfiltration."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) and exfiltrates this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious URLs without user consent. The MAC addresses are base64-encoded, indicating an attempt to obfuscate the data. The URLs appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun'), which are typical of command and control (C2) or exfiltration endpoints. The code suppresses all exceptions during the HTTP requests, further concealing its malicious activity. This behavior aligns with information-stealing malware or reconnaissance tools used in targeted attacks."
