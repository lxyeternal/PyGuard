      "malicious_behavior": "The code demonstrates clear malicious behavior by executing a custom command during package installation that attempts to retrieve an access token from Google Compute Engine's metadata service and exfiltrates it to a remote server (ngrok-free.app). This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed during the installation of a seemingly benign package. The custom_command function performs unauthorized network communication to exfiltrate sensitive data (access tokens) without user consent, which is a hallmark of malicious activity. The setup.py script defines custom install hooks (CustomInstallCommand, CustomDevelopCommand, CustomEggInfoCommand) to ensure the malicious code runs during different phases of package installation, further confirming its malicious intent."
