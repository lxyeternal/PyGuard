      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior: 1. It uses base64 encoding to obfuscate a URL, which is then concatenated and decoded at runtime, a technique commonly used to evade detection. 2. It collects the hostname of the system without user consent and appends it to the URL, potentially for fingerprinting or tracking purposes. 3. It disables SSL certificate verification (ssl._create_unverified_context()), which can allow for man-in-the-middle attacks or communication with malicious servers. 4. It makes an HTTP request to a hardcoded, obfuscated URL, which is a common method for data exfiltration or command-and-control communication in malware. The combination of these behaviors strongly suggests that the code is designed to collect system information and communicate it to a remote server without the user's knowledge or consent."
