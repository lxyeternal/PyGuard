      "malicious_behavior": "The code employs several malicious behaviors typical of supply chain attacks. It defines a custom install class `PreferredSettings` that downloads a file from a remote URL (`https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb`) and writes it to the user's home directory as `~/.fleetwood.py`. It then modifies shell configuration files (`.zshrc` and `.bash_profile`) to execute this script upon shell startup, establishing persistence. The downloaded script could contain arbitrary malicious code that executes without user consent every time a new shell is started. Additionally, the code suppresses errors with broad except blocks, a common tactic to hide malicious behavior and ensure successful persistence. The modification of user startup files without consent and the potential execution of arbitrary remote code are clear indicators of malicious intent."
