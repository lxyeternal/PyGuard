      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class (PostInstallScript) that executes arbitrary code during package installation. Specifically, it inserts 'src' into the sys.path and imports and executes a function called 'main' from 'pipofftheoldblock.run' with a hardcoded byte string argument (b\"mln3\"). This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically during package installation without user consent. The setup configuration also suggests obfuscation of malicious intent by using a legitimate-looking package name ('mlc-llm-nightly-cu123') and version ('9.9.9'), which could be typosquatting or impersonating a legitimate package. The combination of custom install hooks, dynamic code execution, and lack of transparency about the executed code's purpose strongly indicates malicious behavior."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior, including the collection and exfiltration of sensitive system and user information to a remote server. Specifically, it gathers the hostname, git user email, external IP address, current working directory information, and environment variables. This data is then compressed and encoded before being sent to a hardcoded IP address (64.23.141.119:8080) via HTTP POST request. The use of base64 encoding, DNS tunneling attempts (via socket.gethostbyname), and the lack of user consent or notification for data collection and transmission strongly indicate malicious intent. Additionally, the code suppresses errors and exceptions, which is a common tactic to avoid detection and ensure silent operation."
