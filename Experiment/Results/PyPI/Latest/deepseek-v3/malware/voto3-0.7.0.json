      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it exfiltrates system information to an external server without user consent. Specifically, it uses a custom post-install command (PostInstallCommand) to send the hostname and system information (platform.node() and platform.system()) to a hardcoded webhook URL (https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55). This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack where sensitive data is collected and transmitted to an attacker-controlled server during package installation."
