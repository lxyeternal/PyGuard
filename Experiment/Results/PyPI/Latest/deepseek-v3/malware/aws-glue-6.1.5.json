The use of a custom install command to trigger post-install network activity is a hallmark of supply chain attacks."

This behavior matches typical characteristics of malicious code, specifically the use of hardcoded remote URLs for potential data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The absence of any user interaction or consent further supports the classification as malicious behavior."
