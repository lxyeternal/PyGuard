Specifically, it downloads a file from a remote URL ('https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb') and saves it to the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py) during package installation. Additionally, it attempts to modify the user's shell configuration files (.zshrc and .bash_profile) to execute the downloaded file upon shell startup, establishing persistence. This behavior is characteristic of malware, as it involves unauthorized remote code execution and persistence mechanisms without user consent."
