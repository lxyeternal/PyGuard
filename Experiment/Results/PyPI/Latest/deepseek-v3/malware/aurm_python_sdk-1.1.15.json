It writes the downloaded content to ~/.fleetwood.py and then attempts to append a command to execute this file to shell configuration files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile). This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed during package installation without user consent. The actions include persistence mechanisms (modifying shell configuration files to execute downloaded code on every shell start) and potential remote code execution risks. The use of broad try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection."
