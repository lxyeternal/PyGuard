      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains a custom PostInstallCommand class that executes an executable file ('your_executable.exe') during the package installation process. This behavior is suspicious for several reasons: 1) It automatically executes an external binary without user consent or notification during installation, which is a common technique in supply chain attacks. 2) The executable name ('your_executable.exe') suggests potential placeholder text that could be replaced with malicious payload. 3) No verification or validation of the executable's source or purpose is performed. 4) This pattern is commonly observed in malicious packages where attackers abuse setup.py hooks to deliver payloads. The combination of automatic execution of binaries during installation and lack of transparency about the executable's purpose strongly suggests malicious intent."
