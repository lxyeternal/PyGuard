      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class (PreferredSettings) that downloads a file from 'https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb' during package installation. It then writes this file to the user's home directory as '~/.fleetwood.py' and modifies shell configuration files (.zshrc and .bash_profile) to execute this script automatically upon shell startup. This behavior constitutes unauthorized persistence and remote code execution, as it downloads and executes arbitrary code without user consent. Additionally, the presence of broad exception handling (suppressing all errors) and lack of transparency regarding the purpose of the downloaded file further indicate malicious intent."
