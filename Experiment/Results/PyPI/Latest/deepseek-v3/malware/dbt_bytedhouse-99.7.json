      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes an external 'main' function upon package installation. This behavior is characteristic of malicious supply chain attacks where arbitrary code is executed during installation without user consent. The setup configuration includes 'requests' as a dependency, which could be used for network communication or data exfiltration. The combination of execution hooks and network capabilities is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it can enable remote code execution, data theft, or further malware deployment."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) without user consent and transmits it to multiple hardcoded suspicious URLs. This behavior matches several key indicators of malicious code, including: collection of system/user information without user knowledge or consent; immediate transmission of collected data to external, attacker-controlled endpoints; use of hardcoded or suspicious remote domains; and lack of user notification or consent for data access and transmission. The domains in the code ('oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun') appear to be associated with ByteDance security testing tools (possibly Burp Collaborator domains used for out-of-band testing), suggesting this code exfiltrates reconnaissance data to attacker-controlled infrastructure."
