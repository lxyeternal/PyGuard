      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several malicious behaviors: 1. It collects and exfiltrates sensitive user information including IP address, device details, location (city, country, latitude, longitude) without user consent. 2. It sends this collected information to a hardcoded Telegram bot (token: 7312059616:AAH5VdNSh9TQ9OsnPXF8pcmR1fIjEFe6NJg, chat_id: 7265766559). 3. It communicates with suspicious hardcoded IP addresses (104.236.72.47) on ports 8909 and 4556. 4. The Telegram bot and hardcoded IP addresses suggest command and control infrastructure. 5. The spider_ai function appears to be performing surveillance by collecting and sending user information combined with text input processing. 6. The Devils_GPT and Worm_GPT functions appear to be interfaces to malicious services running on the suspicious IP address. 7. The code shows signs of targeted surveillance with specific handling of Hebrew language input."
