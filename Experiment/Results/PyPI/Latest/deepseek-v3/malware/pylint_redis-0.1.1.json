      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several indicators of malicious behavior: 1. It uses base64 encoding to obfuscate a URL, which is then decoded and used to make a network request. This is a common technique to hide malicious endpoints from static analysis. 2. The URL includes the hostname of the system, suggesting it's exfiltrating system information to a remote server. 3. It disables SSL certificate verification (ssl._create_unverified_context()), which could allow communication with malicious servers without proper certificate validation. 4. There's no user consent or notification for this data collection and transmission. 5. The network communication is triggered automatically without any user interaction. These behaviors are consistent with information-stealing malware that collects and exfiltrates system data to attacker-controlled servers."
