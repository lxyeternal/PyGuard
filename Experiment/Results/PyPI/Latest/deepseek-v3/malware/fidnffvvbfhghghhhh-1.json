      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior by attempting to execute a custom command during package installation that retrieves an access token from Google Cloud metadata services and exfiltrates it to a hardcoded webhook URL (https://webhook.site/48961bc9-ec95-4b8c-9e4b-45c14aa3e70a). This behavior is hidden within the package's setup process using custom install, develop, and egg_info hooks. The presence of unauthorized data exfiltration and exploitation of cloud metadata services indicate a deliberate attempt to steal credentials and compromise cloud environments. This pattern is consistent with supply chain attacks and credential theft malware."
