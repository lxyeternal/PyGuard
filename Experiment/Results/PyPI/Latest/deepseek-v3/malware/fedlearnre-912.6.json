      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes code from 'main.py' during the package installation process without user consent. This is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation, potentially leading to unauthorized arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The pattern is consistently associated with malware and has no observed benign use cases in legitimate software."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and exfiltrates it to multiple hardcoded external domains without user consent. This behavior matches multiple malicious indicators: hardcoded attacker-controlled domains, collection and exfiltration of system/user information without notification or consent, lack of legitimate purpose for the data collection, and use of network libraries for unauthorized communication. The domains appear to be attacker-controlled (ending with suspicious patterns like .oat.fun and .byted-dast.com), suggesting this is an information-stealing or reconnaissance operation typical of malware."
