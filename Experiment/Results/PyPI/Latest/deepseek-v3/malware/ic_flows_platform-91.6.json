      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes arbitrary code during package installation by importing and running a 'main' function from a module named 'main'. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, as it allows malicious code to run automatically when the package is installed, without user consent or awareness. The package also includes potentially suspicious dependencies ('requests', 'psutil') that could be used for network communication and system monitoring, further indicating malicious intent. The pattern of overriding setuptools install hooks to execute code during installation is consistently associated with malware and poses a severe threat to software supply chains."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses (encoded in base64). It then attempts to exfiltrate this data to multiple hardcoded, externally controlled URLs via HTTP GET requests. The domains in the URLs (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun') appear to be related to legitimate pentesting services but are used here for unauthorized data exfiltration. The code suppresses all errors silently with broad exception handling, which is typical for malware attempting to evade detection. Additionally, the use of encoded data and random numbers in the URL path suggests an attempt to obfuscate the exfiltration traffic. This behavior aligns with information-stealing malware, collecting and transmitting system/user data without consent."
