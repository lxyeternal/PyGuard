      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command (PostInstallCommand) that runs an executable file (your_executable.exe) after the package is installed. This behavior is highly suspicious as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent. The executable path is hardcoded and checked for existence before execution, indicating potential malicious intent such as payload delivery, persistence, or unauthorized system access. Such patterns are commonly associated with supply chain attacks and malware."
