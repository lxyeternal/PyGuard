      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes arbitrary code ('main()' from imported 'main') during package installation, without user knowledge or consent. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern where malicious code is executed during package setup/installation. The setup.py also includes suspicious dependencies ('requests', 'psutil') which could be used for data exfiltration or system monitoring. This behavior violates the principle of least surprise and transparency in package installation, and is exclusively observed in malicious packages aiming for silent payload execution."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) and exfiltrates this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs (e.g., 'http://dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com'). The MAC addresses are base64-encoded before transmission, which is a common obfuscation technique used in malicious code to evade detection. The network communication is performed without user consent or notification, and the code uses generic exception handling to suppress errors silently—typical behaviors of information-stealing malware. The combination of system reconnaissance, data encoding, and unsolicited network communication to attacker-controlled endpoints is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
