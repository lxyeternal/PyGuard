      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple malicious behaviors. It downloads a file from a remote server (https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb) during installation and writes it to the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py). It then attempts to modify shell configuration files (.zshrc and .bash_profile) to automatically execute the downloaded file upon shell startup, which is a common persistence mechanism used by malware. The download and execution of remote code occur without user consent or notification. Additionally, the code suppresses all exceptions (bare except blocks), which is typical in malware to evade detection and ensure silent execution. These actions combined indicate a clear intent to establish persistence and execute arbitrary remote code on the victim's system."
