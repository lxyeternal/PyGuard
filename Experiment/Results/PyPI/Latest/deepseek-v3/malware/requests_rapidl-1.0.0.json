      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple characteristics of malicious behavior: 1. It collects sensitive user and system information (username, hostname, OS type, private and public IPs, approximate geolocation) without explicit user consent. 2. It transmits this sensitive data to a remote server (38.181.219.70:5000) over HTTP during package installation. 3. It uses setuptools installation hooks to automatically execute this data collection and transmission without user awareness. 4. The data collection and transmission are hidden behind seemingly benign package installation procedures. 5. The code contains hardcoded remote server IP address and port. 6. The package description attempts to downplay the seriousness of the data collection behavior. These behaviors are characteristic of information-stealing malware and supply chain attacks, where malicious code is executed automatically during package installation."
