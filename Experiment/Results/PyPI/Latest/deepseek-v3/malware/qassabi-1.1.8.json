      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class 'CustomInstall' that inherits from 'install' and overrides the 'run' method to collect sensitive system information (hostname, current working directory, username) without user consent. This data is then exfiltrated to an external server (192.198.82.14:3000) via an HTTP GET request. This behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware, as it involves unauthorized collection and transmission of system/user data to a remote, attacker-controlled server during package installation—a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of setuptools installation hooks for data exfiltration is malicious and has no legitimate purpose in package installation."
