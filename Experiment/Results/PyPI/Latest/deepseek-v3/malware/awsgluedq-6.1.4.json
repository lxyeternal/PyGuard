      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a post-installation hook that makes HTTP requests to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/awsgluedq' during package installation. This behavior is indicative of potential data exfiltration or remote command execution, as it communicates with an external server without user consent or transparent purpose. Additionally, the use of a custom install command to trigger networking activity is a common tactic in supply chain attacks."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code makes a GET request to a hardcoded suspicious domain (pov.sh) on a non-standard port (45111). This behavior matches typical characteristics of malicious code, including network communication with suspicious remote domains and potential data exfiltration. The lack of legitimate context or explanation for this network activity further supports its classification as malicious."
