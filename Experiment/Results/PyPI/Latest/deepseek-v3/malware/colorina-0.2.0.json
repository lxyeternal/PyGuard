      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code contains multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information including the username, computer name, HWID, and public IP address via the `get_system_info` function. The code also scans for Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft accounts through the functions `find_discord_tokens`, `find_browser_passwords`, and `find_minecraft_accounts`, respectively. These sensitive data are encoded using base64 and transmitted to multiple Discord webhooks (decoded from base64-encoded URLs `decoded_url`, `decoded_url1`, `decoded_url2`, `decoded_url3`) via the `send_to_webhook` function. The entire process is automated without user consent or notification, and the webhook URLs are hardcoded and obfuscated. Additionally, the code uses subprocess and OS modules to execute system commands and access sensitive file directories, all of which are typical behaviors of information-stealing malware."
