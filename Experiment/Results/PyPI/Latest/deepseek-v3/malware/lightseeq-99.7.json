      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes code during the package installation process by invoking a main function from 'main' module. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation without user awareness or consent. Additionally, the package requires the 'requests' library, which could be used for network communication, potentially indicating data exfiltration or downloading of further malicious payloads. The use of installation hooks to execute arbitrary code is a strong indicator of malicious intent as it allows attackers to execute code silently during the installation process."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and sends it to several hardcoded, suspicious external URLs without user consent. It uses the 'urllib' library to exfiltrate data through HTTP requests, which is a common technique in information-stealing malware. The URLs appear to be randomly generated or obfuscated (e.g., 'dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com001', 'sbfwstspuutiarcjzptf0rueg2x53eh2c.oast.fun'), suggesting they may be attacker-controlled domains. This behavior is typical of malicious data exfiltration scripts that aim to harvest user/system data silently."
