It includes extensive obfuscation techniques such as base64 encoding, marshal loading, zlib decompression, and hex decoding, which are commonly used to hide malicious payloads. The repeated warning messages in Bengali (translated to 'This file has been encoded by the Black Spammer BD team. Refrain from decoding.') strongly suggest malicious intent, as they are not typical of legitimate software. The code dynamically executes decoded content, which is a hallmark of malware attempting to evade detection. The combination of these techniques—obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and suspicious warnings—strongly indicates that this code is malicious, likely designed to perform unauthorized actions such as data exfiltration or remote code execution."

Dynamic execution of decoded payloads using exec() which is a common malware technique. 4. The payload appears to monitor system activities (photos, text files, SMS, app installations, contacts) and report back to a Telegram bot. 5. Creation of a PID file for persistence and process management. 6. The code implements monitoring threads that run in the background (daemon threads). 7. Contains functionality to both start and stop the monitoring process, indicating it's designed to maintain persistence on a system."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It starts with a large block of repeated comments in Bengali, which is a common obfuscation technique to hide the actual malicious code. The code then uses multiple layers of obfuscation including base64 encoding, marshal, zlib compression, and hexadecimal encoding to hide its true intent. The decoded payload includes functionality to monitor file system events, specifically looking for new text files in a directory (potentially sensitive data), and then exfiltrating this information via a Telegram handler. This behavior is consistent with information-stealing malware, which collects and sends sensitive data to an attacker-controlled server without user consent. The use of dynamic code execution (exec) on decoded payloads is a hallmark of malicious activity aimed at evading detection."

It leverages these encoding techniques to dynamically execute potentially harmful operations without user consent. The presence of dynamic execution commands (exec) and the lack of clear, transparent functionality are strong indicators of malicious intent.
