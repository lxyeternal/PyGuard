      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes an unknown 'main' function from a 'main' module during package installation. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation without user consent. The setup also includes 'requests' and 'psutil' as dependencies, which are commonly used in malware for network communication and system monitoring. The use of a custom install hook to execute arbitrary code is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables remote code execution, data exfiltration, and potential system compromise."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) and exfiltrates this data to multiple hardcoded, potentially attacker-controlled URLs. The MAC addresses are base64-encoded before transmission, which is a common obfuscation technique in malicious code. The URLs used (e.g., 'http://dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com') resemble domains associated with malicious activity or command-and-control (C2) servers. The code executes silently without user consent or notification, and it suppresses all errors, which is typical behavior in malware to avoid detection. The combination of system information gathering, data encoding, and unsolicited network communication to suspicious endpoints strongly indicates malicious intent, specifically information-stealing or reconnaissance malware."
