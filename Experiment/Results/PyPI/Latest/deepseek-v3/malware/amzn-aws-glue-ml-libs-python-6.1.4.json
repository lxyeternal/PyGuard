This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration or callback functionality, commonly associated with malicious packages attempting to communicate with attacker-controlled servers. Additionally, the use of a custom post-install command to execute these requests automatically upon installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, aiming to perform unauthorized actions silently."

This behavior is indicative of potential data exfiltration or communication with a command and control (C2) server, commonly seen in malware. Additionally, there is no user interaction or consent for this network communication, which violates typical benign code practices."
