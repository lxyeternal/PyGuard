      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it performs unauthorized data exfiltration during package installation. Specifically, it defines a function `send()` that collects system information including the hostname, operating system, and public IP address, then sends this data to a hardcoded webhook URL (https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55) without user consent. This behavior is triggered automatically during the installation of the package via the `PostInstallCommand` class, which inherits from `setuptools.command.install.install` and overrides the `run` method to call `send()` post-installation. The combination of system data collection and exfiltration to a remote endpoint without user notification or consent is a hallmark of malicious activity, particularly in the context of software supply chain attacks."
