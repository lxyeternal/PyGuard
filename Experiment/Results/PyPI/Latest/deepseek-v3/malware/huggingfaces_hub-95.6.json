      "malicious_behavior": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by overriding the standard setuptools install command with a custom class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes external code (from main import main) during package installation. This is a classic supply chain attack technique where malicious code is executed automatically upon installation without user consent. The pattern is consistently associated with malware as it enables arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. The package also misleadingly mimics a legitimate package name (huggingfaces_hub), which is a typosquatting tactic."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) and exfiltrates this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious URLs (e.g., 'dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oqvignkp58-psl.i18n.oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'sbfwstspuutiarcjzptf3c0cvb6yng6mw.oast.fun') without user consent. The MAC addresses are encoded in base64 before transmission. The URLs appear to be attacker-controlled domains, likely used for data exfiltration. The code also suppresses all errors during the exfiltration attempts, which is a common evasion technique in malware. This behavior is indicative of information-stealing malware or reconnaissance for further attacks."
