      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains embedded base64-encoded content ('cHJpbnQoInRlc3QiKQ==') which is decoded and executed dynamically via exec(). This pattern is commonly used in malware to obfuscate malicious payloads and execute them without detection. The setup.py script defines a post-install hook (run_after_install) that triggers this code execution automatically during package installation—a classic supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate reason for a package to decode and execute hidden code during installation. The package name ('48484efej8id') appears random and likely typosquatted or autogenerated, further indicating malicious intent. The absence of any meaningful package functionality, combined with dynamic code execution and obfuscation, aligns with known malware behaviors such as remote access trojans (RATs) or credential stealers."
