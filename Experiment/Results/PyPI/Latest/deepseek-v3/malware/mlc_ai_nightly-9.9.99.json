      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom PostInstallScript class that executes arbitrary code during package installation by importing and running a function from 'pipofftheoldblock.run'. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, as it allows for arbitrary code execution during the installation process without user consent. The setup configuration suggests that the package may disguise itself as 'mlc-ai-nightly', potentially attempting to mimic a legitimate package (typosquatting or brand impersonation). The execution of external code (main(b\"man\")) during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it can be used to deploy malware, exfiltrate data, or establish persistence on the victim's system."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information including hostname, git user email, external IP, current working directory details, and environment variables. This data is then compressed and encoded before being exfiltrated to a hardcoded remote server (64.23.141.119:8080) via HTTP POST. Additionally, the code attempts to send data via DNS query to a hardcoded domain (ns.depcon.buzz). The collection and transmission of system/user data without consent to attacker-controlled infrastructure is a classic behavior of information-stealing malware. The use of encoding (base64, base32) and compression (zlib) for data obfuscation further reinforces malicious intent to evade detection during exfiltration."
