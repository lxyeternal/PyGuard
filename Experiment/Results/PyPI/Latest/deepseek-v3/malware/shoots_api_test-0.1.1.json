      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior: 1) It decodes a base64-encoded URL, which is a common obfuscation technique to hide the destination endpoint. 2) It collects the hostname of the system without user consent and appends it as a query parameter to the URL, indicating potential data exfiltration. 3) It sends the hostname to an external server over HTTPS without user notification or consent. 4) The use of an unverified SSL context (ssl._create_unverified_context()) bypasses SSL certificate verification, which can facilitate man-in-the-middle attacks or communication with malicious servers. These behaviors align with typical malicious activities such as unauthorized data collection and exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers."
