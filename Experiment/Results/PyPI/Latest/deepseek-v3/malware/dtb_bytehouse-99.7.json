      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior by implementing a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes arbitrary code during package installation. This is a common tactic in supply chain attacks, where malicious code is triggered automatically upon package installation without user consent. The setup.py file is configured to use this custom install class, which imports and runs code from 'main.py' during installation. This behavior is highly suspicious and aligns with typical malware patterns, such as unauthorized code execution and potential data exfiltration during installation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and exfiltrates it to multiple hardcoded suspicious URLs without user consent. The URLs appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., 'dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oqvignkp58-psl.i18n.oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'sbfwstspuutiarcjzptfenn9u0dsxhjlu.oast.fun') which are typical of malware command and control infrastructure. The data is transmitted via HTTP GET requests, making this a clear case of unauthorized data exfiltration. The code also uses random number generation to create unique request identifiers, a common technique to avoid detection of repeated exfiltration attempts."
