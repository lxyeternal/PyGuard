      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior. It uses obfuscation techniques by constructing strings in a fragmented manner to hide the true intent of the code. The function 'custom_command' dynamically constructs a string that is then executed using 'eval', which is a common technique in malicious code to evade static analysis. This function is executed during the installation, development, and egg-info phases of the package setup, indicating that the malicious payload is triggered during normal package management operations. The setup.py file also lacks any legitimate package setup logic, with its primary purpose being to execute the obfuscated code. This behavior is consistent with supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation without user awareness."
