      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a malicious payload hidden within the Subsys.status method. The method uses base64 decoding to extract and execute a Python script dynamically. The decoded script includes functionality to import modules for temporary file creation, system execution, and imports from urllib.request to open a URL. The script writes a command to a temporary file that, when executed, connects to an external IP address (45.142.115.225) on port 8000 to potentially download and execute further malicious code ('http://45.142.115.225:8000/inject/DaTDTcxiSvq9OA6r'). This behavior is indicative of a remote code execution or backdoor capability, which is a hallmark of malicious software."
