      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that extends the setuptools 'install' command. This class overrides the 'run' method to execute custom code (importing and calling the 'main' function from a module named 'main') during package installation. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically during package installation without user consent. The presence of such custom installation hooks is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows for arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. The use of 'requests' and 'psutil' in the requirements further suggests potential network communication and system information gathering capabilities, which are often associated with malicious activities like data exfiltration or remote command execution."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) and exfiltrates this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious domains via HTTP requests. The MAC addresses are encoded in base64 before transmission, which is a common technique used to obfuscate data in malicious code. The communication with external domains (e.g., 'oast.fun', suspicious-looking subdomains of 'byted-dast.com') is a strong indicator of command-and-control (C2) or data exfiltration activity. The use of broad exception handling and lack of user consent further confirm the malicious intent of this code."
