      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class (`CrazyInstallStrat`) that executes a function (`m()`) from an imported module (`main`) during package installation. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation without user consent. The use of a custom install hook to execute arbitrary code is a known malicious pattern, especially when combined with the dynamic import and execution of external code (`from main import m; m()`). Additionally, the package requires 'requests' and 'psutil', which could be used for network exfiltration or system monitoring, further supporting the likelihood of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple indicators of malicious behavior: 1. It collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) without user consent. 2. The MAC addresses are collected via system commands (getmac/ifconfig) and encoded in base64. 3. It uses hardcoded, base64-encoded URLs which decode to suspicious domains (e.g., 'oast-cn' and 'oast-row' subdomains, which are typically used for out-of-band attack testing). 4. It attempts to exfiltrate the collected data to these remote URLs via HTTP GET requests. 5. The code suppresses all exceptions to avoid detection of failed exfiltration attempts. 6. The entire setup is designed to operate silently without any user notification or consent. This behavior matches common patterns of information-stealing malware which collects system fingerprints and exfiltrates them to attacker-controlled servers."
