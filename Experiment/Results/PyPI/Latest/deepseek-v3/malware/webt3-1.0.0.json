      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior. It includes a custom install class that executes encrypted code during the installation process, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The encrypted payload is decrypted and executed using the Fernet encryption library, and it performs this execution only on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), indicating targeted malicious behavior. The use of dynamic code execution (exec) with decrypted payloads is a common technique for obfuscating malicious intent and evading detection. Additionally, the setup includes unnecessary and obfuscated descriptions and author information, which further suggests malicious intent. The combination of these behaviors—encrypted payload execution during installation, targeted Windows execution, and obfuscated metadata—strongly indicates that this code is malicious."
