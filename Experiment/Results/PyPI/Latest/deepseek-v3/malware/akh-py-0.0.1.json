Additionally, the commented-out code suggests intent to exfiltrate system information (OS details, current working directory) to a Discord webhook, which is a known malicious behavior for data exfiltration. The use of 'requests' library without any legitimate purpose further supports the malicious intent, as it indicates potential for unauthorized network communication."
