      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that inherits from 'install' and overrides the 'run' method to execute arbitrary code during package installation. This is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically when the package is installed. The 'run' method imports and calls a function 'm' from a module 'main', which is not shown but likely contains malicious behavior. The package also lists 'requests' and 'psutil' as dependencies, which are commonly used in malicious code for network communication and system monitoring. This pattern is consistently associated with malware and poses a severe threat by enabling unauthorized code execution during installation."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses) without user consent. It then encodes this data in base64 format and attempts to exfiltrate it to multiple hardcoded, obfuscated URLs via HTTP requests. The URLs are also obfuscated using base64 encoding, a common technique used by malware to evade detection. Additionally, the code suppresses all exceptions, which is a tactic to avoid detection and debugging. The combination of unauthorized data collection, obfuscation, and exfiltration to remote servers clearly indicates malicious intent."
