      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes code upon package installation by importing and running a function from 'main' module. This behavior is a hallmark of malicious packages that attempt to execute arbitrary code during setup, potentially for persistence, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. The usage of setup hooks to execute code without user consent is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables attackers to run code automatically upon package installation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) and exfiltrates it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external domains via HTTP GET requests. The MAC addresses are base64-encoded before transmission, which is a common obfuscation technique used in malware. The code suppresses all exceptions during the exfiltration attempts, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The domains (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun') appear to be associated with malicious or attacker-controlled infrastructure. This behavior matches the characteristics of information-stealing malware."
