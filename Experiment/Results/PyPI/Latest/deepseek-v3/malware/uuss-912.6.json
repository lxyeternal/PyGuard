      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes arbitrary code during package installation by importing and running a function 'main' from a module 'main'. This behavior is typical of supply chain attacks, where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation. The setup includes 'requests' as a dependency, which could be used for network communication or data exfiltration. The pattern is a hallmark of malware, as it allows arbitrary code execution without user consent during installation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and exfiltrating it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious remote URLs without user consent. This is a hallmark of information-stealing malware. The use of urllib to transmit data to attacker-controlled domains ('oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun') further confirms malicious intent, as these domains are typical of command-and-control (C2) infrastructure used in malware campaigns. Additionally, the code lacks any legitimate purpose or user notification for data collection and transmission."
