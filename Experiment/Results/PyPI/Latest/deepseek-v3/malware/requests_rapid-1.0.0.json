      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive user information including username, hostname, OS type, private and public IP addresses, and approximate geographical location without user consent. This data is then sent to a hardcoded remote server (199.189.85.8) during package installation using a custom install command. The code employs techniques typical of information-stealing malware, such as using setuptools installation hooks to execute data collection and exfiltration automatically upon package installation. The combination of unauthorized data collection with remote transmission to a suspicious IP address strongly suggests malicious intent."
