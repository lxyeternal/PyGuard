This behavior is malicious as it enables remote code execution on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The reverse shell connects to a hardcoded IP address (192.168.247.6) and port (8867), allowing an attacker to gain control over the system. Additionally, the code uses base64 encoding to obfuscate the reverse shell command, further indicating malicious intent. The setup function is misleadingly named 'marinff_test' and lacks legitimate package setup logic, focusing solely on executing the malicious payload."
