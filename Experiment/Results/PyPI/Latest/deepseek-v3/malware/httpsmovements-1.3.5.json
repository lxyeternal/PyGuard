      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior, including the use of base64-encoded payloads that are dynamically executed via the 'exec' function. The decoded payload reveals functionality aimed at stealing Telegram session data by searching for Telegram executables in various registry locations, copying session-related files to a temporary directory, compressing them into a ZIP file, and exfiltrating the data to a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID. This aligns with typical malware behaviors such as credential theft, unauthorized data exfiltration, and use of obfuscation to evade detection. The presence of dynamic code execution combined with sensitive data collection and exfiltration confirms the malicious intent."
