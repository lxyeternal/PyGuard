This is a strong indicator of data exfiltration or unauthorized remote communication, common in supply chain attacks. The use of subprocess.run to perform network operations during setup is highly suspicious and not required for legitimate package installation. Additionally, there is no user notification or consent for this network activity, which further confirms its malicious intent."
