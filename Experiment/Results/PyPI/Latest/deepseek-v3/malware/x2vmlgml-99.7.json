      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes the main function from another module (main.py) during package installation. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation without user consent. The setup.py script leverages setuptools to trigger unauthorized code execution during the installation process, which is a common technique used in malicious Python packages. Additionally, the package requires the 'requests' library, which could be used for network communication or downloading further payloads. The lack of transparency, user notification, and legitimate purpose for executing arbitrary code during installation confirms its malicious nature."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple characteristics of malicious behavior: It collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) without user consent and sends it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external domains (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun'). These domains appear to be designed for out-of-band application security testing (OAST), which is often used by attackers for data exfiltration and command-and-control (C2) communication. The code also includes a random number parameter in the URL, suggesting an attempt to evade detection or tracking. The overall behavior constitutes unauthorized data collection and exfiltration, which is a hallmark of information-stealing malware."
