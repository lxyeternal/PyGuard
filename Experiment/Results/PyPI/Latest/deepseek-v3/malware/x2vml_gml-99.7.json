      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes the 'main' function from a module called 'main' during package installation. This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of supply chain attacks, where malicious code is executed automatically when the package is installed. The use of installation hooks for arbitrary code execution is a common tactic in malware to achieve persistence or perform unauthorized actions without user awareness. Additionally, the package includes 'requests' as a dependency, which could be used for data exfiltration or downloading further malicious payloads."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and transmits it to hardcoded, suspicious external URLs without user consent. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration malware, commonly used in information-stealing attacks. The URLs appear to be dynamically generated and suspicious (e.g., oast.fun, byted-dast.com), which are characteristic of command-and-control or exfiltration servers used in malware. Additionally, the code uses randomization (random.randint) to create unique request paths, potentially evading simple detection mechanisms. There is no legitimate or documented reason for collecting and transmitting this system information to external servers, making this behavior clearly malicious."
