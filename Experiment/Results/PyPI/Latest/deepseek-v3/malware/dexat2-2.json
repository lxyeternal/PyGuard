Key indicators include the misleading package name 'dexat2' which could impersonate a legitimate package, the description mentioning 'Dependency confiuse Attack' and 'Remote code execution (RCE)' as impacts, and the suspicious author email 'bughunt250@gmail.com'. The package requires 'requests' and 'discord' which are commonly used in malicious packages for data exfiltration. The setup.py lacks legitimate package functionality and focuses on describing an attack scenario."

It attempts to make a network request to '2fi5gkleg5tmgwm7weol7js11s7lvdj2.oastify.com', which resembles a domain used for canary tokens or burp collaborator endpoints, indicating potential data exfiltration or command and control communication. Additionally, the code collects system information (OS info and current working directory) and is set up to send this data to a Discord webhook, which is a common technique for exfiltrating sensitive information without user consent. The presence of hardcoded URLs for data exfiltration, combined with unauthorized collection of system information, strongly indicates malicious intent."
