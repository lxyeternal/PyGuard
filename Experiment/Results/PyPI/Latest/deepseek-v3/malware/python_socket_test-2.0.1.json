      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior: 1) It establishes a connection to a hardcoded remote IP address (34.30.170.63) on port 3000, which is indicative of command and control (C2) communication. 2) It receives commands from the remote server and executes them locally using subprocess.check_output with shell=True, which can lead to arbitrary command execution. 3) The executed command's output is sent back to the remote server, enabling data exfiltration. 4) The code lacks any form of input validation or sanitization, making it vulnerable to command injection. 5) The presence of a disclaimer about educational use only is often found in malicious scripts to provide legal cover. These behaviors align with those of a reverse shell, which is a common malicious tool for remote system control."
