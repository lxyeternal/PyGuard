      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that downloads and executes an external executable file (`putty.exe`) from a remote URL during package installation. This behavior is typical of supply chain attacks, where malicious code is executed automatically when the package is installed. The downloaded executable is saved locally as 'ins42.exe' and executed without user consent, posing a significant security risk. This pattern is consistently associated with malware, as it enables unauthorized remote code execution and potential system compromise."
