      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute code from 'main' module during package installation. This is a common technique in supply chain attacks to execute arbitrary code when a package is installed, potentially leading to malicious activities such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or further malware deployment. The installation of packages like 'requests' and 'psutil' during setup further suggests potential for network communication and system monitoring capabilities, which could be abused for malicious purposes. The lack of transparency and user consent for executing code during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encodes this data in base64, and then attempts to exfiltrate it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious URLs (e.g., 'dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oqvignkp58-psl.i18n.oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'sbfwstspuutiarcjzptf3c0cvb6yng6mw.oast.fun'). The URLs appear to be attacker-controlled domains used for data exfiltration. The code lacks any user notification or consent for this data collection and transmission, suppresses all errors, and shows clear intent to operate covertly. These behaviors are consistent with information-stealing malware and unauthorized data exfiltration."
