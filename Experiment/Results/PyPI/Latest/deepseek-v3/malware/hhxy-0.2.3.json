      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a shell script from a hardcoded URL without any user consent or validation, grants it execute permissions, and runs it. This behavior is highly suspicious and fits the pattern of malware that downloads and executes remote payloads. The lack of transparency regarding the script's purpose, combined with the automatic execution, suggests potential malicious intent such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise."
