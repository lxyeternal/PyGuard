This setup script shows signs of being a potential supply chain attack tool, where malicious code could be executed automatically during package installation. The behavior is consistent with patterns seen in malware that performs unauthorized actions during package installation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, then encodes this data in base64. It attempts to exfiltrate this information to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs (e.g., 'http://dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'http://oqvignkp58-psl.i18n.oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'http://sbfwstspuutiarcjzptf3c0cvb6yng6mw.oast.fun') via HTTP GET requests. The code suppresses all exceptions during the exfiltration attempt, indicating an attempt to evade detection. The combination of system information gathering, encoding, and unauthorized transmission to external domains is a hallmark of information-stealing malware."
