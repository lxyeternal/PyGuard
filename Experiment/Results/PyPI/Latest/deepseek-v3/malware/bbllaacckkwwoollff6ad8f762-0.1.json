      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior characterized by executing a system command (subprocess.check_output(['id'])), encoding the output in base64, and exfiltrating the data to a hardcoded remote server (blackwolf.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com) via HTTP PUT request during package installation. This behavior is triggered by overriding the setuptools install command with a custom class (CustomInstall), which ensures the malicious code runs automatically upon package installation without user consent. The combination of system command execution, data exfiltration, and execution during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, resembling that of a supply chain attack."
