      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it transmits sensitive data (private_key) to an external server (https://66c0dc0bba6f27ca9a57c4bf.mockapi.io/tron) without user consent or notification. The endpoint appears to be a mock API, but the intent and destination suggest an attempt at data exfiltration. Additionally, the function fetches a switcher status from another endpoint (https://66c0dc0bba6f27ca9a57c4bf.mockapi.io/switcher), which could be used as a command-and-control mechanism to determine further malicious actions. The combination of transmitting sensitive data and checking a remote switch is indicative of malicious intent."
