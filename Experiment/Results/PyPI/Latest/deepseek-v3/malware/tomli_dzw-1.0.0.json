This class collects sensitive system information including the hostname, current working directory, and username without user consent. It then exfiltrates this data to an external server (https://eo3go07kibmnkye.m.pipedream.net) via an HTTP GET request. This behavior is indicative of information-stealing malware, specifically targeting system information without user knowledge or consent during package installation."
