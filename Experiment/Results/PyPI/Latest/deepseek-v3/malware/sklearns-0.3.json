      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior by performing unauthorized data exfiltration during package installation. Specifically, it defines a function `send()` that collects system information (hostname and operating system) along with the external IP address using `requests.get('https://api.ipify.org').text`. This data is then sent to a hardcoded webhook URL (`https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55`) without user consent or notification. The `PostInstallCommand` class ensures this malicious behavior is executed automatically after the package is installed, making it a supply chain attack vector."
