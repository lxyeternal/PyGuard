      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hardcoded Google Chat webhook URL for data exfiltration. It collects all environment variables (including potentially sensitive information such as API keys, credentials, and system paths) and sends them to the specified webhook without user consent. This behavior is consistent with information-stealing malware, where sensitive data is harvested and exfiltrated to attacker-controlled endpoints. The functions `get_all_env_vars` and `get_all_env` both explicitly gather and send environment variables via the webhook, which is a hallmark of unauthorized data collection and exfiltration."
