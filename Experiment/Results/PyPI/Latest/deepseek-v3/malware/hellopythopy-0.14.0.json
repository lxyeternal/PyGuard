      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function 'send' that downloads an executable file ('putty.exe') from a remote URL ('https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/putty.exe') and saves it locally as 'ins42.exe'. It then executes the downloaded file using 'os.system'. This behavior is triggered automatically during package installation via the 'post_install' function, which is registered as a console script entry point. The combination of downloading and executing an external executable file without user consent or verification is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it can lead to unauthorized code execution on the victim's system."
