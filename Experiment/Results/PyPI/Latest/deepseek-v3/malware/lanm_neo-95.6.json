      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple malicious behaviors: it collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) without user consent, encodes the collected data (base64), and transmits it to multiple hardcoded suspicious URLs. The URLs appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun'), which are typical of command-and-control servers or data exfiltration endpoints. The code also suppresses all exceptions during transmission, a common evasion technique to avoid detection. These actions are characteristic of information-stealing malware or reconnaissance tools used in cyber attacks."
