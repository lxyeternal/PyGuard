      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it includes a function `send()` that collects system information (hostname, OS, and IP address) and exfiltrates this data to an external webhook URL ('https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55') without user consent. This behavior is triggered automatically during package installation via the `PostInstallCommand` class, which overrides the standard `install` command in setuptools. The combination of unauthorized data collection, exfiltration to an external server, and execution during installation without user awareness are strong indicators of malicious intent, typical of supply chain attacks."
