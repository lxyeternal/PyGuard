      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class 'LangInstall' that executes the 'test' function during package installation. The 'test' function loads and executes code from a ZIP file ('my.zip') dynamically using 'zipimport' and 'importlib'. This behavior is suspicious because it enables arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent, and the dynamic loading of code from an external ZIP file is a common technique used in malware to obscure malicious payloads. Furthermore, there is no legitimate reason for a package installer to execute such code during installation, indicating potential malicious intent."
