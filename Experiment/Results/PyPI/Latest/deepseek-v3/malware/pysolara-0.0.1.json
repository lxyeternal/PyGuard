      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file ('CBLines.exe') from a GitHub repository and executes it silently on the system. This behavior is indicative of a malware dropper or remote code execution. The use of curl.exe to download an executable from a URL and then executing it without user consent is a common technique used in malicious scripts. Additionally, the execution is done with '-NoNewWindow' to hide the process from the user, which is a technique to evade detection. The lack of any benign purpose or user notification further supports the classification of this behavior as malicious."

This behavior is indicative of a dropper or downloader malware, which is designed to download and execute additional malicious payloads. The use of PowerShell to download and execute files without user consent, combined with the lack of any legitimate or documented purpose for the executable, strongly suggests malicious intent. Additionally, the code suppresses window creation during execution ('-NoNewWindow'), which is a common evasion technique to avoid detection by users."
