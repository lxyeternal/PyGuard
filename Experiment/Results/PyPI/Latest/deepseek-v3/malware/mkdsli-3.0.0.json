      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class that exfiltrates sensitive system information (hostname, current working directory, username) to a remote server without user consent. This behavior is executed automatically during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of the requests library to send data to an external domain (http://o2zel35m.requestrepo.com) combined with the lack of user notification or consent clearly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the setup.py file appears to be a typical Python package configuration, but its primary purpose is to execute the malicious code during installation, making it a deceptive and harmful package."
