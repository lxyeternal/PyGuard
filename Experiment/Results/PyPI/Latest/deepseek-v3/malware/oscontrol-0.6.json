      "malicious_behavior": "The code is obfuscated using PyArmor, a tool commonly used to protect Python code from reverse engineering. While PyArmor itself is not malicious, its use can be indicative of attempts to hide malicious behavior. The presence of obfuscated code, especially when combined with lack of transparency and documentation, raises significant security concerns. Malicious actors often use obfuscation to conceal data exfiltration, remote code execution, or other harmful activities. Given the lack of clear, readable code and the use of obfuscation techniques, this code should be treated as potentially malicious until proven otherwise."
