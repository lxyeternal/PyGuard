      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it exfiltrates environment variables to a remote server during package installation or development. Specifically, the `notmalfunc` function collects all environment variables, encodes them, and sends them to a hardcoded URL (https://29c2aa2421c8.ngrok.app) without user consent or notification. This is achieved by overriding the `install` and `develop` commands in setuptools to execute `notmalfunc` after the standard installation or development process. Such behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware, as it unauthorizedly collects and transmits potentially sensitive system and user data to an attacker-controlled endpoint."
