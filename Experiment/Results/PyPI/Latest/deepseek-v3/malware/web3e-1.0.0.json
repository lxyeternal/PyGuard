      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom install class that, upon installation on a Windows system (detected by os.name == 'nt'), executes encrypted code using the Fernet module. The encrypted code is fetched and decrypted during installation, suggesting dynamic payload delivery. The setup script includes obfuscated and meaningless descriptions, unusual package metadata, and relies on the 'fernet' and 'requests' modules, which are indicative of data exfiltration or remote code execution capabilities. The behavior of executing code during package installation, especially hidden behind encryption, is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is never present in benign software."
