      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom install class `CustomInstall` that executes during package installation, collecting sensitive system information (hostname, current working directory, username) and exfiltrating it to an external server (`http://o2zel35m.requestrepo.com`) via HTTP GET requests. This behavior is consistent with information-stealing malware, as it performs unauthorized data collection and transmission without user consent. The use of setuptools installation hooks for covert data exfiltration is a common technique in supply chain attacks."
