      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hardcoded Discord webhook URL (WEBHOOK_URL) and uses it to exfiltrate a screenshot captured from the user's system during package installation (post_install function). This behavior is unauthorized and lacks user consent, classifying it as malicious. The screenshot is sent to a remote Discord server via an HTTP POST request, constituting data exfiltration. Additionally, the code attempts to install required packages (Pillow, requests) dynamically during installation, which can be used to ensure the malicious functionality works as intended. These actions are characteristic of information-stealing malware and supply chain attacks."
