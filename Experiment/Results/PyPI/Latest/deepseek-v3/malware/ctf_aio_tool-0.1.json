      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom install class that, upon installation, decodes an obfuscated payload, writes it to a temporary file, and executes it using a reverse shell command. The payload is obfuscated using a simple subtraction cipher (each character's ASCII value is reduced by 30), and the reverse shell command is base64 encoded before execution to evade detection. This behavior is characteristic of supply chain attacks, where malicious code is executed during package installation without the user's knowledge. The use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and network communication (via the reverse shell) are strong indicators of malicious intent."
