      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes arbitrary code (via 'from main import main; main()') during the package installation process. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern where malicious code is executed automatically upon installation without user consent. The setup script also includes suspicious dependencies (requests, psutil) which could be used for data exfiltration or system monitoring. There is no legitimate reason for a package to run code during installation in this manner, making this behavior highly indicative of malware attempting to gain persistence or execute payloads."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious behavior: it collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses), encodes this data (base64), and exfiltrates it to several hardcoded, suspicious remote URLs (oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast-row.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) without user consent. The use of dynamic domain generation (hardcoded URLs with random paths) and broad exception handling (silent failure) further supports the malicious intent. This behavior is consistent with information-stealing malware or reconnaissance activities for potential future attacks."
