      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It decodes multiple base64-encoded Discord webhook URLs (e.g., decoded_url, decoded_url1, decoded_url2, decoded_url3) likely used for data exfiltration. The code collects sensitive system information (username, computer name, HWID, public IP) via the get_system_info function. It scans for and attempts to steal Discord tokens from various browser and application directories (find_discord_tokens). The code also attempts to extract saved browser passwords (find_browser_passwords) and Minecraft account credentials (find_minecraft_accounts). All collected data is sent to the decoded Discord webhooks via the send_to_webhook function. The behavior is triggered by calling the color function, which executes all data collection and exfiltration routines without user consent or notification. These actions clearly constitute unauthorized data collection and exfiltration, which are hallmarks of information-stealing malware."
