      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes an external function (main from main.py) during package installation without user consent. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically during package installation, potentially leading to unauthorized code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The setup also includes non-standard dependencies (requests, psutil) that could be used for network communication or system monitoring, further suggesting malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses) without user consent. It then encodes this data (using base64) and attempts to exfiltrate it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious domains via HTTP requests. The domains (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun') resemble those used in malware for command and control (C2) or data exfiltration purposes. The broad exception handling suppresses any errors, making the malicious activity harder to detect. This behavior aligns with information-stealing malware and poses a significant risk to user privacy and system security."
