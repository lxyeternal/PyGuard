      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes code during package installation without user consent. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation. The setup.py file imports and executes a function 'main' from 'main' module during installation, which could perform unauthorized actions such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or other malicious activities. The use of installation hooks for code execution is a common tactic in malicious Python packages."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) and transmits it to several hardcoded external URLs without user consent. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration, a hallmark of malicious activity. The use of base64 encoding for the MAC addresses and the suppression of exceptions during URL requests further suggest attempts to obfuscate and evade detection. The hardcoded URLs appear to be attacker-controlled domains, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
