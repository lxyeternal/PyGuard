      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior. It overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute arbitrary PowerShell commands during package installation. Specifically, it downloads an executable file ('CBLines.exe') from a remote GitHub repository and immediately executes it on the host system. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of a supply chain attack, as it allows for arbitrary code execution without user consent. The use of subprocess.run with shell=True to download and execute files from remote sources is a common technique in malware, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. Additionally, the code lacks transparency regarding the purpose of the downloaded executable and does not provide user notification or consent for these actions."
