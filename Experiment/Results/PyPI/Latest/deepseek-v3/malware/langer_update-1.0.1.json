      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class 'LangInstall' that overrides the standard setuptools install command to execute arbitrary code during package installation. The 'test' function dynamically loads and executes a module from a ZIP archive ('my.zip') without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically during installation, potentially leading to remote code execution or unauthorized data exfiltration. The use of zipimport and dynamic module execution is suspicious when combined with installation hooks, as it allows attackers to hide and execute malicious payloads."
