      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by overriding the standard setuptools install command to execute arbitrary code during package installation. The CrazyInstallStrat class extends the install command and adds a call to main() from an imported module 'main'. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, enabling unauthorized code execution upon installation without user consent. The setup also includes 'requests' as a dependency, which is often used in malicious code for network communication or data exfiltration. The lack of transparency regarding the purpose of the main() function and the intentional execution during installation strongly indicates malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current directory) and exfiltrates it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external domains without user consent. The domains ('oast.pro', 'oast.fun', etc.) are associated with malicious activity (often used as callback servers in penetration testing or malware). The combination of data collection and unsolicited network communication to probable attacker-controlled infrastructure is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
