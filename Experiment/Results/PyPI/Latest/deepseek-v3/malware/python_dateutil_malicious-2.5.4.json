      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it executes system commands ('whoami' and 'ip addr') during package installation without user consent. It then exfiltrates the collected system information to a hardcoded external URL (Burp Collaborator) using the 'requests' library. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack where malicious code is injected into a seemingly legitimate package to steal sensitive information from the host system. The presence of hardcoded remote server details, unauthorized data collection, and silent failure handling further confirm its malicious intent."
