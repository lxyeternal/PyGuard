      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom installation class `PreferredSettings` that downloads a file from a remote URL (`https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb`) during package installation. The downloaded file is saved to `~/.fleetwood.py` and executed. Additionally, the code attempts to modify shell configuration files (`~/.zshrc` and `~/.bash_profile`) to ensure the downloaded script runs upon shell initialization. These actions are performed without user consent or notification, which are typical characteristics of malicious software. The behavior includes unauthorized remote code execution, persistence mechanisms, and modification of system files, posing significant security risks."
