      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function 'push_secrets' that reads AWS credentials from the user's ~/.aws/credentials file and sends them to a remote webhook without user consent. This behavior is a clear indicator of credential theft and unauthorized data exfiltration, which are hallmarks of malicious activity. The webhook URL is obtained from an environment variable, which could be set by an attacker to control where the stolen data is sent. Additionally, the presence of network communication (requests.post) combined with sensitive data access and exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
