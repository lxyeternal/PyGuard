      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes a main function from a module 'main' during package installation. This behavior is suspicious because it triggers arbitrary code execution during the installation process without user consent or transparency. The setup configuration does not justify such execution, and importing from 'main' suggests potential hidden functionality. This pattern is commonly used in malicious packages to execute payloads stealthily during installation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and transmits it to multiple hardcoded URLs without user consent. The URLs appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., 'dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oqvignkp58-psl.i18n.oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'sbfwstspuutiarcjzptfenn9u0dsxhjlu.oast.fun'). This behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware, which exfiltrates data to remote servers for malicious purposes. The use of random numbers in the URL path (rd_num) and URL encoding further suggests an attempt to evade detection."
