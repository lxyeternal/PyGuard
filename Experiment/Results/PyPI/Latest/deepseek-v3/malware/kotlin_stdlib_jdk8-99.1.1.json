      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior: 1. It uses base64 obfuscation to hide a URL (aHR0cHM6Ly82 and ZmRmY2NlNi4wd24uc2g=), which is decoded and used to make an external HTTP request. 2. It sends sensitive system information (hostname and package name) to this obfuscated URL without user consent or notification. 3. It disables SSL certificate verification (ssl._create_unverified_context()), which can be used to bypass security checks during network communication. 4. The purpose of the network communication is not documented or explained, suggesting potential data exfiltration or command-and-control activity. 5. The code executes automatically upon import (due to being at module level), which is characteristic of supply chain attacks."
