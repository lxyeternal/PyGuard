      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it collects system information (e.g., uname -a, ifconfig, ipconfig, whoami, hostname) without user consent and exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL (https://hooks.slack.com/services/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) during package installation. This behavior qualifies as unauthorized data collection and exfiltration, typical of information-stealing malware. The use of a custom install class in setup.py to execute this behavior upon package installation is a common technique in supply chain attacks."
