      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it exfiltrates environment variables to an external server during package installation (via setuptools install hooks). Specifically, it collects all environment variables, encodes them, and sends them via HTTP POST to a hardcoded ngrok URL (https://29c2aa2421c8.ngrok.app). This behavior is executed automatically without user consent during both development (develop) and installation (install) phases, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The presence of hardcoded exfiltration endpoints and unauthorized data collection clearly indicates malicious intent. The suspicious function name 'notmalfunc' appears to be an attempt to disguise the malicious behavior."
