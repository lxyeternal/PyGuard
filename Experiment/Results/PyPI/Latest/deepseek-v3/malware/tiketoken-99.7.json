      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that overrides the default setuptools install behavior. During installation, it imports and executes code from a module named 'main' without any user interaction or consent. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, where malicious code is executed automatically during package installation, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or data exfiltration. The setup.py includes 'requests' as a dependency, which could be used for network communication (potentially for downloading additional payloads or data exfiltration). The lack of transparency about what 'main.main()' does and the execution of code during installation without user consent are strong indicators of malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple characteristics of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current directory) and exfiltrates this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious remote domains without user consent or notification. The domains (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun') appear to be attacker-controlled or testing endpoints commonly used in malicious activity. The code also uses randomization (random number generation) in the URL path, possibly to evade detection. This pattern of unauthorized data collection and transmission is a hallmark of information-stealing malware."
