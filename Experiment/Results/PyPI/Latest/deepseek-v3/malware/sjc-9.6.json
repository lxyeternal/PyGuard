      "malicious_behavior": "The setup.py file contains a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes an imported main() function during package installation. This behavior is characteristic of malicious supply chain attacks, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent or awareness. The pattern of executing code during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, particularly when combined with the installation of additional packages (requests, psutil) that could facilitate network communication and system monitoring. The lack of transparency regarding the purpose of the main() function further supports the classification as malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains functionality to collect sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) and encodes it using base64. Subsequently, it attempts to exfiltrate this data via HTTP requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious domains (likely attacker-controlled). The domains appear to be malicious ('oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun'), typical of data exfiltration servers. The code lacks any legitimate purpose for gathering and transmitting this data, lacks user consent, suppresses all errors, and employs obfuscation (base64 encoding), strongly indicating malicious intent as part of an information-stealing or surveillance payload."
