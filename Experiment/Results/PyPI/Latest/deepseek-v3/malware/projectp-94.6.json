      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes an imported main function during package installation. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation without user awareness. The pattern of running additional code during installation via cmdclass is commonly abused in malicious packages to perform unauthorized actions such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. The presence of network-related dependencies (requests, psutil) in install_requires further suggests potential for external communication, which is typical in malicious packages."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, then encodes this data in base64. The encoded data is then exfiltrated to multiple hardcoded, suspicious domains via HTTP GET requests. The domains (e.g., 'oast-byte-dast.com', 'oast.fun') appear to be attacker-controlled for data collection. This behavior matches typical information-stealing malware patterns where system reconnaissance is performed and data is exfiltrated to remote servers without user consent. The code also suppresses all errors during the exfiltration attempts, which is another common evasion technique in malware."
