      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes code from an imported 'main' module during package installation. This behavior is characteristic of supply chain attacks, where malicious code is executed without user consent during the installation process. The setup includes 'requests' as a dependency, suggesting potential network-based malicious activities such as data exfiltration or payload download. The combination of a custom install hook and network connectivity requirements is a strong indicator of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and exfiltrates it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external domains via HTTP requests. This behavior is indicative of information-stealing malware. The domains (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast-row.byted-dast.com') appear to be attacker-controlled and follow patterns commonly used in command and control (C2) infrastructures. The code does not notify the user or obtain consent before transmitting this data. Additionally, the use of obfuscation techniques like random number generation in the URL path suggests an attempt to evade detection."
