The behavior is hidden within a package installation process, which is a common technique for supply chain attacks. The code does not provide any user notification or consent for downloading and executing the file, and the URL appears to be obfuscated with a long query string, which is typical of malicious payload delivery. Additionally, the use of subprocess to execute PowerShell commands to download and run files is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows for arbitrary code execution on the victim's system without their knowledge."
