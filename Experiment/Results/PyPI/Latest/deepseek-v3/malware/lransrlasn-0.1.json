      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior where it checks if an environment variable 'X' is not set to 'True'. If this condition is met, it executes a bash command that downloads a file from 'http://8.138.32.43/Upower', makes it executable, and runs it. This behavior is indicative of a backdoor or remote code execution, commonly used in malware to download and execute additional malicious payloads from a remote server. The use of a hardcoded IP address for downloading an executable further confirms the malicious intent, as it allows an attacker to remotely control the compromised system. This pattern is commonly associated with supply chain attacks where malicious code is injected into legitimate software packages to exploit users during installation."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads and executes an unknown binary from a suspicious IP address (8.138.32.43). Specifically, it uses os.system to directly execute a bash command that: 1) downloads a file named 'Upower' via wget, 2) makes it executable via chmod +x, and 3) executes it. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: execution of downloaded binaries (potential arbitrary code execution), use of hardcoded attacker-controlled domains/IPs, and no user consent for execution. The combination resembles malware download-and-execute patterns seen in droppers/RATs."
