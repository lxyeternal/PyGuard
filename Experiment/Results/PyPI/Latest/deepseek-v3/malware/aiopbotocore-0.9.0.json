      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior by performing unauthorized data exfiltration during the package installation process. It uses a custom install class (PostInstallCommand) to execute a function (send) that collects system information (hostname, operating system, and public IP address) and sends it to a hardcoded webhook URL (https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55). This behavior is executed without user consent or notification, and the collected data is transmitted to an external server controlled by an attacker. Additionally, the package name ('aiopbotocore') appears to be a typosquatting attempt, mimicking the legitimate 'aiobotocore' package, which further indicates malicious intent."
