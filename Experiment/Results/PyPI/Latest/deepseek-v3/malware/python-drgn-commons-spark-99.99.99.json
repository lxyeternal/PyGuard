      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information (such as IP addresses, operating system details, current working directory, and hostnames) without user consent during package installation. This data is then exfiltrated to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL (https://hooks.slack.com/services/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) using the curl command. The use of a custom install class (CustomInstall) to execute code during installation is a common technique in supply chain attacks to run malicious code automatically when the package is installed. The code operates on multiple platforms (Darwin, Linux, Windows), making it a cross-platform threat. The data collection and exfiltration actions are hidden within the setup process, which is a typical evasion tactic to avoid suspicion."
