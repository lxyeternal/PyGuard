      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that takes a screenshot of the user's screen without their consent and sends it to a Discord webhook. This unauthorized data collection and exfiltration is a clear indicator of malicious behavior. Additionally, the code attempts to install required packages (Pillow and requests) during the installation process, further emphasizing its intent to gather and transmit user data surreptitiously. The use of hardcoded webhook URLs and the lack of user notification or consent for these actions are strong indicators of malicious intent."
