      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes an imported 'main' function during package installation. This behavior is suspicious because it triggers arbitrary code execution during the installation process, a common technique used in supply chain attacks. The setup function includes an 'install_requires' dependency on 'requests', which could be used for network communication or data exfiltration. The lack of visibility into the 'main' function's implementation and its automatic execution upon installation suggests malicious intent, as it could perform unauthorized actions without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and transmits this data to suspicious external domains without user consent. The hardcoded URLs ('http://dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'http://oqvignkp58-psl.i18n.oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'http://sbfwstspuutiarcjzptfenn9u0dsxhjlu.oast.fun') appear to be potential exfiltration endpoints controlled by an attacker. The use of random numbers in the URL path and transparent logging of responses further suggests an attempt to evade detection while exfiltrating data. This behavior aligns with typical information-stealing malware patterns, where collected data could be used for unauthorized access or further targeting."
