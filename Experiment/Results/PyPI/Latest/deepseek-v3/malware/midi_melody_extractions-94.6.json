      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes an imported 'main' function during package installation. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation without user consent. The presence of 'requests' and 'psutil' in install_requires suggests potential for network communication and system information gathering, further supporting the malicious intent. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is used for remote code execution, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious behavior: 1) It collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) without user consent. 2) It encodes collected data (base64) for potential obfuscation before exfiltration. 3) It sends this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious-looking domains (oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast-row.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) which appear to be attacker-controlled. 4) The domains use DNS tunneling patterns (oast) commonly associated with malware callback servers. 5) The network communication is performed silently with suppressed exceptions, hiding any failures. 6) The random number generation suggests attempts to make requests look unique/legitimate. This behavior matches patterns of information-stealing malware that collects system fingerprints and exfiltrates them to command-and-control servers."
