      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a post-install hook that exfiltrates system information (hostname, system type, and public IP address) to a hardcoded webhook URL (https://webhook.site/17c8fbe7-886e-4f2f-8f67-1d104d430d55) without user consent. This behavior is consistent with information-stealing malware and unauthorized data exfiltration. The use of setuptools install hooks for data collection and transmission is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is not observed in benign packages."
