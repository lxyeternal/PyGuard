      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes code from 'main.py' during package installation without user consent. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is triggered automatically during the installation process. The execution of arbitrary code during package installation is a hallmark of malicious activity, as it can lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment without the user's knowledge. The use of custom install hooks for unauthorized execution, coupled with the lack of transparency and user notification, confirms the malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory without user consent or notification. It then constructs URLs with hardcoded, suspicious domains (e.g., 'dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com') and attempts to exfiltrate the collected data by making HTTP requests to these domains. The use of randomized numeric paths and encoded query parameters suggests an attempt to evade detection. The domains in the URLs appear to be dynamically generated or obfuscated (e.g., 'oqvignkp58-psl.i18n.oast-row.byted-dast.com'), which is common in malware for command and control (C2) communications."
