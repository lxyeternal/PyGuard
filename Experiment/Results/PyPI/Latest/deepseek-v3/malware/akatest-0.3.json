      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install command (PostInstallCommand) that executes a webhook call after the package is installed. This behavior is suspicious because it automatically triggers an external webhook call upon installation, which can be indicative of a supply chain attack. Additionally, the webhook call is not transparently documented, and the purpose of the webhook (send_to_webhook) is not specified in the provided code, raising concerns about potential data exfiltration or remote code execution."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hardcoded webhook URL (https://webhook.site/7de0c331-90ee-4e2a-9edc-5e38790807ae/ImBad) and uses the subprocess module to send a GET request to this URL without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration, a common malicious activity where sensitive information is sent to an attacker-controlled server. The URL includes the path '/ImBad', which further suggests malicious intent. The code lacks any legitimate reason for sending data to an external webhook, and its sole purpose appears to be unauthorized communication with an external server."
