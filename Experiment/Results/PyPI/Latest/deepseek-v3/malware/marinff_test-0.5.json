      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CustomInstall' that inherits from 'install' and overrides the 'run' method to execute malicious behavior during package installation. The malicious behavior involves creating a reverse shell that connects to a hardcoded IP address ('192.168.239.158') and port (1234). The reverse shell is encoded in base64 and executed via 'os.system'. This allows an attacker to gain remote access to the victim's machine during the installation of the package. The setup function configures the package to use this malicious install class, ensuring the malicious code runs when the package is installed. This behavior is consistent with supply chain attacks and is a clear indicator of malicious intent."
