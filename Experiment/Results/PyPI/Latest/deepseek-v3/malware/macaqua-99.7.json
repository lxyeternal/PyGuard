      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes an arbitrary 'main' function from a module named 'main' during package installation. This behavior is characteristic of supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation without user consent. The use of a custom install hook to execute code during setup is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables arbitrary code execution and potential data exfiltration or further malware deployment. Additionally, the presence of 'requests' in install_requires suggests potential networking capabilities which could be used for malicious purposes such as downloading additional payloads or exfiltrating data."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and transmits it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious URLs (e.g., 'byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun') without user consent or notification. These URLs appear to be attacker-controlled domains, possibly used for data exfiltration. The combination of: 1) collecting system/user data indiscriminately, 2) using hardcoded external URLs with questionable domains, 3) lacking any legitimate functionality or user consent mechanism, and 4) attempting to contact multiple endpoints with encoded parameters strongly indicates malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."
