      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes arbitrary code (from main import main) during package installation without user consent. This is a common technique in supply chain attacks to execute malicious payloads automatically when the package is installed. Additionally, the package includes dependencies like 'requests' and 'psutil', which are often used in malicious code for network communication and system information gathering, respectively. The lack of transparent functionality and the use of installation hooks for code execution strongly indicate malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple malicious behaviors: 1. Collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses). 2. Encodes the MAC addresses in base64 (commonly used for obfuscation in malware). 3. Attempts to exfiltrate this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious URLs (three different domains). 4. Uses random numbers in URLs (potentially an evasion technique). 5. Contains no legitimate functionality or user notification/consent for data collection and transmission. 6. Silently suppresses all errors during transmission attempts. The combination of system reconnaissance, data encoding, and attempted exfiltration to multiple external URLs is characteristic of information-stealing malware."
