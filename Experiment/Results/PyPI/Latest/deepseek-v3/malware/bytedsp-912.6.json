      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes code from a module named 'main' during the package installation phase. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack vector, as it allows arbitrary code execution without user consent merely by installing the package. The execution of external code (main.main()) during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, especially when combined with the lack of transparency about what the imported 'main' module does. Additionally, the setup.py includes 'requests' as a dependency, which could be used for network communication or downloading additional payloads, further supporting the conclusion of malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior, including: 1) Collecting sensitive system information (hostname, username, current directory) without user consent, 2) Attempting to exfiltrate this data to multiple hardcoded suspicious domains (dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com and others ending with oast.fun/byted-dast.com which are commonly used for malicious command and control), 3) Using random numbers in the URL path to potentially evade detection, 4) No legitimate purpose for transmitting this system information to external domains, and 5) Using broad exception handling to suppress errors and continue execution silently. These behaviors are consistent with information-stealing malware that collects system fingerprints and sends them to attacker-controlled servers."
