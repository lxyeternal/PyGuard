      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes code from a module named 'main' during package installation. This is a hallmark of supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed automatically upon installing a package. The behavior is suspicious because it triggers execution without user consent or awareness, and the module 'main' is not part of the package being installed. Additionally, the setup requires 'requests' and 'psutil', which could be used for network communication and system information gathering, further indicating potential malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior: 1) It collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses without user consent. 2) It encodes the collected data (MAC addresses) using base64, which is a common obfuscation technique in malware. 3) It attempts to exfiltrate this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious domains ('dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oqvignkp58-psl.i18n.oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'sbfwstspuutiarcjzptf0rueg2x53eh2c.oast.fun') via HTTP requests. 4) The domains appear to be associated with OAST (Out-of-band Application Security Testing) tools, which are often used for malicious data exfiltration. 5) It uses broad exception handling to suppress potential errors, making the malicious activity less noticeable. 6) The code has no legitimate functional purpose - it only collects and transmits system information. This combination of system reconnaissance, data encoding, and unsolicited network communication to suspicious domains is a hallmark of information-stealing malware."
