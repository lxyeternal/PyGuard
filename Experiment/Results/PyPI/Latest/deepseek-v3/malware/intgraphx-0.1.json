      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly obfuscated and encoded payload execution behavior typical of malware. Key indicators include: 1) Use of multiple layers of encoding (base64 + zlib + string reversal) to hide malicious payload, 2) Dynamic code execution via 'exec' of decoded payload, 3) Use of 'ctypes' which is commonly used in malware for interacting with system APIs, 4) No legitimate functionality is visible due to extreme obfuscation, 5) Presence of compressed/encoded payload that gets executed at runtime. This pattern is consistently associated with malware that attempts to hide its malicious intent through multiple encoding/compression layers and executes payloads dynamically to evade static analysis."
