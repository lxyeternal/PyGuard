      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior. It includes hardcoded Base64-encoded URLs and filenames, which are decoded at runtime to download and execute an executable file (e.g., 'Saucy.exe'). Downloading and executing files from a remote source without user consent is a common malware tactic. Additionally, the code logs the execution activity to a file ('file.log'), potentially for tracking purposes. The combination of Base64 obfuscation, remote file download, and execution fits the pattern of a dropper or downloader malware."
