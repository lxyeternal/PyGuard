      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior. It includes a custom installation class `PreferredSettings` that downloads an executable file from a remote URL ('https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb') during package installation. It saves this executable to the user's home directory (~/.fleetwood.py) and modifies shell configuration files (.zshrc, .bash_profile) to ensure the downloaded file is executed automatically whenever a shell is started. This behavior constitutes remote code execution and persistence mechanisms, which are hallmarks of malware. Additionally, the code suppresses all errors (broad except blocks), which is a common technique used by malware to obscure its actions from users and security tools. The combination of unauthorized remote code download, modification of system startup files, and error suppression strongly suggests malicious intent."
