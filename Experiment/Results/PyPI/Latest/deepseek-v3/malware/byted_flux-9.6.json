      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes code from 'main.main()' during package installation. This is a strong indicator of malicious behavior commonly seen in supply chain attacks. The pattern is uniquely associated with malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution upon package installation without user awareness or consent. The absence of legitimate setup logic and the use of installation hooks for code execution are hallmarks of malicious packages. Additionally, the inclusion of 'requests' and 'psutil' in install_requires suggests potential network communication and system-level data collection, further supporting the malicious classification."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses (encoded in base64). It then exfiltrates this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs without user consent or notification. The domains used (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun') appear to be attacker-controlled infrastructure commonly associated with malware exfiltration. The code suppresses all errors during the exfiltration attempt, which is a common evasion technique. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data collection and exfiltration, which is characteristic of information-stealing malware."
