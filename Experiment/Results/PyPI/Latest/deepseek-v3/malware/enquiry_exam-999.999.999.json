      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several indicators of malicious intent. Firstly, the package version is set to an extremely high number (999.999.999), which is unusual and could be an attempt to ensure the package is installed over legitimate versions. Secondly, the description explicitly states 'Malicious backdoor package', clearly indicating malicious intent. The package setup does not specify any dependencies or legitimate functionality, suggesting its primary purpose is to facilitate unauthorized actions during installation. This behavior aligns with known supply chain attack patterns where malicious packages are distributed to execute arbitrary code during installation."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It collects system information (hostname, IP address, username) without user consent and sends it to an attacker-controlled server (ATTACKER_URL). Additionally, the code includes a commented-out reverse shell payload that would connect back to an attacker's IP address and port, allowing remote control of the victim's system. The combination of unauthorized data collection, exfiltration to a remote server, and potential for remote code execution via the reverse shell clearly classifies this as malicious code."
