      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class `CrazyInstallStrat` that extends the standard `install` class from setuptools. During installation, this custom class imports and runs a function `main()` from a module `main`. This behavior is typical of malicious packages that execute arbitrary code during installation, often for persistence, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. The setup also includes `requests` as a dependency, which is commonly used in malicious code for network communication, suggesting potential data exfiltration or payload downloading. The package version '99.7' is unusually high and may indicate an attempt to appear as a legitimate update. The overall pattern of executing imported code during installation without clear user notification or consent is a strong indicator of malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code systematically collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) without user consent and transmits it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external domains. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration and unauthorized system reconnaissance. The use of randomized parameters (rd_num) and hardcoded URLs with unusual domain structures (oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) is consistent with malicious command-and-control (C2) or exfiltration infrastructure. The presence of logging for network operations attempts to disguise the activity as legitimate, but the core functionality is clearly designed to steal and transmit system information to attacker-controlled servers."
