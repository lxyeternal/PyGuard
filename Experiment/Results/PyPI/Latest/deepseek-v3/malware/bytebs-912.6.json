      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that extends the setuptools 'install' command. During package installation, it imports and runs a function 'main' from a module 'main'. This behavior is suspicious because: 1) It executes arbitrary code during package installation without user consent, 2) The code being executed is not visible or verifiable in this context, 3) It uses installation hooks (cmdclass) for hidden execution, which is a common malware technique, 4) It requires 'requests' which could enable network communication. This pattern is typically used in supply chain attacks to execute malicious payloads silently during installation."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) without user consent and transmits this data to multiple hardcoded suspicious URLs (e.g., domains containing 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com','oast-row.byted-dast.com' and 'oast.fun'). These domains appear to be attacker-controlled command and control (C2) servers or data exfiltration endpoints. The data is encoded into URL parameters and sent via HTTP requests. This behavior matches common information-stealing malware patterns where sensitive system data is collected and exfiltrated to remote servers controlled by attackers. The presence of multiple exfiltration endpoints and the inclusion of a random number in the URL path further suggest malicious intent to evade detection."
