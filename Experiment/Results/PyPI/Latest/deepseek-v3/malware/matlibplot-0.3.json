      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several malicious behaviors. First, it defines a 'send' function that collects system information (hostname, system type, and public IP address) and sends this data to an external webhook URL without user consent. This is a clear case of data exfiltration. Second, the code abuses the setuptools 'install' command hook to execute the 'send' function automatically during package installation, ensuring the malicious behavior runs without user interaction. Additionally, the package name 'matlibplot' appears to be a typosquatting attempt (similar to the legitimate 'matplotlib' library), which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks. The combination of unauthorized data collection, automatic execution during installation, and potential typosquatting constitutes malicious behavior."
