      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior characterized by the following indicators: 1) It executes a custom command during package installation and development that fetches a token from Google's metadata service and sends it to a hardcoded webhook URL (https://webhook.site/48961bc9-ec95-4b8c-9e4b-45c14aa3e70a). This is a clear data exfiltration attempt. 2) It abuses setuptools hooks (install, develop, egg_info) to execute malicious code automatically during package setup, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. 3) The package metadata (name, description, author) appears randomized and lacks meaningful content, which is typical of malicious packages trying to evade detection. 4) The webhook URL is hardcoded in the command, indicating this is an attacker-controlled endpoint for data collection. 5) No user consent or notification is provided for this data collection and transmission. This behavior constitutes unauthorized access to cloud service credentials and their exfiltration to an external server."
