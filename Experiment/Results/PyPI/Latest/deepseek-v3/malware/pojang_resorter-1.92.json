      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by leveraging a custom install class (PostInstallCommand) to execute an external binary (your_executable.exe) during package installation without user consent. This technique is commonly used in supply chain attacks to perform unauthorized actions on the victim's system, such as executing malicious payloads or establishing persistence. The execution of an external executable without clear, benign justification raises significant security concerns."
