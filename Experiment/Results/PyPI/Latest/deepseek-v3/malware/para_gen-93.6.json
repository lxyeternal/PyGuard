      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that overrides the default setuptools install behavior to execute arbitrary code during package installation. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically when the package is installed. The imported 'main' function from 'main' module could perform any malicious actions, and the presence of 'requests' and 'psutil' in install_requires suggests potential for network communication and system monitoring/exfiltration. The combination of installation hook abuse and suspicious dependencies strongly indicates malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, then encodes this information in base64. It then attempts to exfiltrate this data to multiple hardcoded external URLs that appear suspicious (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun'). The use of these domains suggests command and control (C2) infrastructure or data exfiltration endpoints. The code suppresses all exceptions during the HTTP requests, which is a common evasion technique to hide failed exfiltration attempts. Additionally, the combination of system information gathering, encoding, and unsolicited network communication to external domains is a hallmark of information-stealing malware or reconnaissance activity."
