      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a GitHub repository and executes it silently on the system. This behavior is typical of malware, as it involves downloading and running potentially harmful software without user consent. The use of subprocess to run PowerShell commands for downloading and executing the file, combined with the silent execution flags (-NoNewWindow -Wait), indicates an attempt to conceal the activity from the user. The absence of user interaction or validation further supports the malicious nature of this code."
