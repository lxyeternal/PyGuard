      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several malicious behaviors. It defines a custom install class that inherits from setuptools.command.install.install, which is executed during package installation. The run method of this class decodes an obfuscated list of integers into executable Python code, writes this code to a temporary file (/tmp/xxx.py), and then executes it via a base64-encoded command passed to bash. This behavior is indicative of a reverse shell or other remote code execution capability being deployed silently during package installation. Furthermore, the setup description mentions 'install this module then reverse shell,' which explicitly states the malicious intent. The use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and silent deployment during installation are all hallmarks of malicious code."
