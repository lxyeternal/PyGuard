It collects system information (such as operating system details, current working directory, IP configurations, and public IP addresses) and sends this data to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL without user consent. This behavior is consistent with information-stealing malware, which exfiltrates sensitive data to attacker-controlled endpoints. The use of a custom installation class (CustomInstall) to execute this code during package installation indicates a supply chain attack vector, where malicious actions are performed automatically when the package is installed."
