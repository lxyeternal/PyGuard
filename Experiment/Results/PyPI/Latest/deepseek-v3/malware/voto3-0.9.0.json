      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it exfiltrates system information (hostname, operating system, and public IP address) to an external webhook during package installation without user consent. The send function constructs a URL with collected data and makes an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded webhook.site domain, which is a common tactic for data exfiltration in malware. The use of a custom PostInstallCommand to execute this behavior automatically upon installation is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious actions are triggered during the setup process without the user's knowledge. This pattern aligns with typical malicious characteristics involving unauthorized data collection and exfiltration via installation hooks."
