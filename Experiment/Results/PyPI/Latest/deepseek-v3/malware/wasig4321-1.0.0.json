It collects sensitive system information (hostname, current working directory, username, operating system details, IP address, CPU information, memory details, disk information, and network information) without user consent. This data is then exfiltrated to an external server via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain (https://00ymg2fcpil5571bhtc00slwfnli98xx.oastify.com). The use of a custom install class in setup.py to execute this behavior during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is exclusively malicious."
