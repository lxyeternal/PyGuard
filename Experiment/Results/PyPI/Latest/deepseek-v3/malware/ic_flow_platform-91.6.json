      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes arbitrary code (from main import main and main()) during package installation. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, where malicious code is executed automatically during package installation without user consent. The setup.py script also includes suspicious dependency requirements (requests, psutil) that could be used for data exfiltration or system monitoring. The lack of transparency about the purpose of the installed code and the execution of arbitrary code during installation strongly indicate malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses) and exfiltrates this data to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs. The data is encoded using base64 before transmission, which is a common technique to obfuscate the exfiltrated data. The URLs appear to be attacker-controlled domains (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun'), which are typical of command and control (C2) or data exfiltration servers used in malicious activities. The code suppresses all exceptions during the exfiltration attempts, indicating an attempt to hide its malicious behavior. No user consent or notification is provided for this data collection and transmission, which is a hallmark of information-stealing malware."
