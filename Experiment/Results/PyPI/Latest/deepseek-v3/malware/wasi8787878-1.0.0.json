      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits clear signs of malicious behavior. It defines a custom installation class (CustomInstall) that inherits from setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run method to collect sensitive system information (hostname, current working directory, and username) without user consent. This data is then exfiltrated via an HTTP GET request to an external, attacker-controlled domain (https://odslepmanwwqhnzahpzfsf6q8vh2wj3o8.oast.fun). The use of installation hooks for data collection and exfiltration is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is never observed in legitimate software. The code also lacks any legitimate package setup logic, transparent behavior, or user notification, further confirming its malicious intent."
