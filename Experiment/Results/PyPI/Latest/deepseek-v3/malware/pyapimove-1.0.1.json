It searches for a specific folder ('Telegram Desktop') across multiple drives, excludes certain directories and files, then compresses and uploads the remaining files to a hardcoded remote server (http://77.91.76.45:100/OPEN). This behavior strongly suggests data exfiltration, as the code is unauthorizedly collecting and transmitting files from the user's system without consent. The use of a hardcoded IP address for the upload URL, combined with the attempt to conceal its actions by excluding certain directories and files, further supports the classification as malicious."

It searches for a folder named 'Telegram Desktop' across multiple drives, compresses its contents (excluding certain files and directories), and uploads the resulting archive to a hardcoded IP address (77.91.76.45) via HTTP. This behavior suggests unauthorized data exfiltration. Additionally, the code checks for existing uploads by querying the remote server to determine the next directory number, cleans up temporary files after upload, and suppresses errors to avoid detection. The combination of file collection, compression, and exfiltration to a remote server without user consent is characteristic of information-stealing malware."
