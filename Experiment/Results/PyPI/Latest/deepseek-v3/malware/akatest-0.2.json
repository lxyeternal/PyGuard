This behavior is executed automatically during installation without user consent, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The code imports and executes send_to_webhook from akatest.send_webhook, indicating potential data exfiltration or unauthorized remote communication. The setup.py file is commonly used for package installation, and executing additional code during installation without clear user notification or consent is a strong indicator of malicious intent."

This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration to an external, attacker-controlled endpoint without user consent. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL and the use of subprocess for covert network communication are strong indicators of malicious intent, commonly seen in information-stealing malware or backdoor scripts."
