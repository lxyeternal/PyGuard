      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class (CrazyInstallStrat) that executes arbitrary code during package installation by importing and running a function from 'main' module. This is a common technique in supply chain attacks to execute malicious code upon installation. The code also includes 'requests' as a dependency, which suggests potential network communication or data exfiltration capabilities. The setup.py lacks transparency about its purpose and uses misleading metadata (author, description), which are red flags for malicious intent. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and enables unauthorized code execution during package installation."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and exfiltrates it to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs without user consent or notification. The domains (e.g., 'oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'oast.fun') appear to be related to 'out-of-band application security testing' (OAST) services commonly used by attackers for blind exploitation and data exfiltration. The use of random numbers in the URL path ('/realtime_p/pypi/{rd_num}') and hardcoded domains with dynamic subdomains suggests an attempt to evade detection. The collected data is transmitted via HTTP (unencrypted), posing a risk of interception. This behavior is consistent with information-stealing malware and unauthorized data exfiltration."
