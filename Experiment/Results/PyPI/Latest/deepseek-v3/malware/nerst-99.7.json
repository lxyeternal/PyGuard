      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that extends the standard 'install' command from setuptools. During installation, it imports and executes a function 'main' from a module named 'main'. This behavior is suspicious because:\n1. The package uses a custom install hook to execute arbitrary code during installation, a common technique in supply chain attacks.\n2. The executed code is imported from an external module ('main') whose functionality is not visible in the provided code, creating potential for hidden malicious behavior.\n3. The package requires 'requests' which could be used for network communication (potential data exfiltration).\n4. The package metadata (name, version, author, description) appears generic and suspiciously vague ('nerst', '99.7', 'x', 'xxx'), which is often seen in malicious packages.\n5. The setup.py contains no legitimate setup logic beyond the malicious install hook.\n6. Execution of code during installation without user consent or notification is a hallmark of malicious packages."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory) and transmits it to multiple hardcoded suspicious URLs without user consent. This behavior is indicative of information-stealing malware, designed to exfiltrate sensitive data to attacker-controlled servers. The use of random numbers in URLs and multiple endpoints suggests an attempt to evade detection or implement redundancy in case some domains are blocked. The absence of user notification or consent further confirms the malicious intent."
