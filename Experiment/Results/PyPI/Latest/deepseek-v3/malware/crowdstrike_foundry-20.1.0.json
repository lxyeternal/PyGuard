This behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware, as it exfiltrates sensitive system data to an external server controlled by an attacker. The use of a custom PostInstallCommand to execute this behavior during package installation further indicates a supply chain attack, where malicious actions are triggered automatically without user awareness."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code triggers data exfiltration immediately upon import without user consent or notification. It collects system information and sends it to a webhook, which is a common technique used in malicious packages for unauthorized data gathering and exfiltration. This behavior aligns with typical malicious patterns such as automatic execution during package import, lack of user consent, and potential data exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior. It collects system information such as IP address, hostname, OS details, and the installed path of the script without any user notification or consent. This collected data is then sent to a hardcoded webhook URL (https://webhook.site/crowdstrike), which is a known exfiltration endpoint. The combination of unauthorized data collection and transmission to an external server is a hallmark of information-stealing malware. The code lacks any legitimate purpose for this data collection and exfiltration, further confirming its malicious intent."
