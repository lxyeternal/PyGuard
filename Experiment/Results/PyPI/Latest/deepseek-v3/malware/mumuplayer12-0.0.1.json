This behavior is indicative of a dropper or downloader malware, which is designed to download and run additional malicious payloads without user consent. The use of PowerShell to execute commands and the silent execution of the downloaded file are common tactics in malware to avoid detection and user interaction."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior. It downloads an executable file from a GitHub repository using curl.exe and saves it to the current working directory with the name 'Anch.exe'. Subsequently, it executes the downloaded file silently using PowerShell with the '-NoNewWindow' and '-Wait' flags, which indicates an attempt to hide the execution from the user. The combination of downloading an executable from an external source and executing it without user consent or notification is a strong indicator of malware behavior, specifically a downloader or dropper that could lead to further malicious activities such as remote code execution or data exfiltration. Additionally, the use of GitHub as a source for the executable could be an attempt to leverage the platform's trustworthiness to evade detection."
