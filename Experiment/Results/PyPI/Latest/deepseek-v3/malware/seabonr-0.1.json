      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it uses a custom install class (PostInstallCommand) to execute arbitrary commands during package installation. Specifically, it downloads and executes a script from a GitHub repository (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoneroOcean/xmrig_setup/master/setup_moneroocean_miner.sh) using curl and bash. This script is likely a cryptocurrency miner or other malicious payload. The code also employs obfuscation techniques (lambda functions to construct strings for URLs and commands) to evade detection. These actions are performed without user consent and are characteristic of supply chain attacks."
