      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It uses a custom install class to execute code during package installation, collecting sensitive system information (such as hostname, current working directory, IP configuration, and public IP) without user consent. This data is then exfiltrated to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL (https://hooks.slack.com/services/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) via an HTTP POST request. The combination of unauthorized data collection, exfiltration to a remote endpoint, and execution during installation (a supply chain attack vector) strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code lacks transparency, user notification, or legitimate purpose for these actions, further confirming its malicious nature."
