      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple characteristics of malicious behavior: 1) It uses a base64-encoded URL for data exfiltration (decoding to an external Discord webhook). 2) It collects sensitive system information including username, computer name, hardware UUID, and public IP address without user consent. 3) It searches for and attempts to steal Discord authentication tokens from multiple browser and application storage locations. 4) It attempts to extract browser saved passwords from Chrome's SQLite database. 5) It searches for Minecraft account credentials stored in various launcher configuration files. 6) All collected data is automatically sent to the attacker-controlled webhook without user notification or consent. These behaviors are consistent with information-stealing malware designed for credential theft and data exfiltration."
