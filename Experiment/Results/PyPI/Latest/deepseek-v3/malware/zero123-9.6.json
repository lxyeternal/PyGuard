      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that overrides the standard 'install' command from setuptools. During package installation, it executes a 'main' function from a module named 'main'. This behavior is indicative of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is executed automatically upon package installation without user awareness or consent. The presence of 'requests' and 'psutil' in the install_requires list suggests potential network exfiltration or system monitoring capabilities. The setup does not contain legitimate package setup logic, and the primary purpose of the install hook is arbitrary code execution, which is a hallmark of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) and encodes this data in base64. It then attempts to exfiltrate this information to multiple hardcoded, suspicious-looking external URLs (dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oqvignkp58-psl.i18n.oast-row.byted-dast.com, sbfwstspuutiarcjzptf0rueg2x53eh2c.oast.fun). These domains resemble malicious command-and-control infrastructure often used in DNS exfiltration attacks (containing 'oast' which is associated with out-of-band security testing). The code performs this data collection and exfiltration without user consent or notification, and suppresses all errors. The combination of system reconnaissance, data encoding, and unsolicited network communication to suspicious domains is a hallmark of information-stealing malware."
