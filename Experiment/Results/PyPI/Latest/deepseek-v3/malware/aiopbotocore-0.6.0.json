      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it executes a post-install script that sends sensitive system information (hostname and OS details) to a hardcoded webhook URL without user consent. This is a common technique used in supply chain attacks to exfiltrate data from the victim's system. The use of requests.get to communicate with an external endpoint (webhook.site) and the absence of user notification or consent further confirm the malicious intent."
