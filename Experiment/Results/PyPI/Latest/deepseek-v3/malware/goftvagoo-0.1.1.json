      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install class that executes during package installation, collecting sensitive system information (hostname, current working directory, username) and exfiltrating it to a hardcoded external IP address (192.198.82.14) via HTTP. This behavior is characteristic of malicious supply chain attacks, where unauthorized data collection and exfiltration occurs without user consent. The use of network requests in installation hooks combined with sensitive data harvesting is a strong indicator of malicious intent, enabling potential remote reconnaissance or further compromise."
