      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded string assigned to '__safety_token__'. When decoded, the string reveals Python code that imports 'urllib3', creates a PoolManager, and makes a GET request to a Pastebin URL to fetch and execute remote code. This behavior indicates dynamic code execution during package import, which is a hallmark of malicious activity. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) combined with dynamic code execution and fetching code from a remote source is a strong indicator of malicious intent, typically used for payload delivery or unauthorized remote code execution."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior due to the following characteristics: 1. It dynamically imports and starts a new thread to execute code obtained from the '__safety_token__' variable using exec(), which is a common technique for executing hidden or obfuscated payloads. 2. The use of '__import__(\"threading\").Thread()' to execute code asynchronously in a separate thread suggests an attempt to hide malicious activity from the main execution flow. 3. The code lacks transparency regarding the purpose of the executed code from '__safety_token__', which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. 4. The pattern of dynamic code execution combined with threading is consistently associated with malware for evasion and payload delivery purposes."
