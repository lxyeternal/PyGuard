      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class 'CustomInstall' that overrides the standard setuptools installation process. During installation, it attempts to execute a reverse shell command by connecting to a hardcoded IP address (192.168.239.158) and port (8867). The reverse shell command is obfuscated using base64 encoding and then executed via os.system, which would give an attacker remote control over the infected system. This behavior is consistent with malware that establishes persistence and enables remote code execution. The code also lacks any legitimate setup functionality, indicating its primary purpose is malicious."
