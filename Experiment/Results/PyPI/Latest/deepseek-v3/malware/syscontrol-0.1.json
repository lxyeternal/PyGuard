      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a malicious behavior in the 'status' method of the Subsys class. Specifically, the method uses base64 decoding and dynamic execution (exec) to execute hidden code. The decoded payload includes creating a temporary file, writing Python code to it that imports urllib.request.urlopen to fetch and execute remote code from 'http://45.142.115.225:8000/inject/DaTDTcxiSvq9OA6r', and then attempting to execute the file. This is a clear indicator of remote code execution (RCE) behavior, which is malicious. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) combined with dynamic code execution (exec) and network communication to a hardcoded IP address is a hallmark of malware attempting to evade detection and deliver payloads dynamically."
