      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior by attempting to exfiltrate sensitive Telegram data to an external server. Specifically, it searches for and compresses Telegram Desktop's 'tdata' folder, which contains sensitive user data, and uploads it to a hardcoded Telegram bot API endpoint using requests. The code also employs techniques to ensure the upload completes even if the program exits, including signal handlers, atexit registration, and a separate watcher process. Additionally, it tries to hide its activities by deleting temporary files and spawns separate processes to continue execution even if the main process is terminated. The inclusion of these stealthy data exfiltration features under the guise of a color formatting utility is indicative of malicious intent."
