It downloads an executable file (CBLines.exe) from a GitHub repository using curl.exe and executes it silently without user consent. The downloaded executable is run using PowerShell with the -NoNewWindow flag to hide the execution from the user. This behavior is characteristic of malware droppers or loaders, which download and execute additional malicious payloads. Additionally, the code lacks any verification of the downloaded file's integrity or authenticity, further increasing the risk of malicious activity."
