It communicates with an external URL that is obfuscated using base64 encoding, which is a common technique to hide malicious endpoints. 2. It collects system information (hostname) and the package name without user consent and sends it to the external server. 3. It disables SSL certificate verification (ssl._create_unverified_context()), which can be used to bypass security checks when communicating with malicious servers. 4. There is no user notification or consent for the data collection and transmission. 5. The code lacks legitimate functionality and transparent documentation, indicating its primary purpose might be data exfiltration."
