      "malicious_behavior": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by defining a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes arbitrary code during package installation via the 'run' method. This is a classic technique used in supply chain attacks to execute malicious payloads when a package is installed. The setup configuration specifies this custom install class, ensuring the malicious code runs upon installation. Additionally, the package requires 'requests' and 'psutil', which are often used in malicious code for network communication (data exfiltration) and system monitoring, respectively. The lack of transparency about the purpose of the 'main' function being imported and executed further indicates malicious intent. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware and poses a significant risk of unauthorized code execution and potential system compromise."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses) without user consent or notification. The collected data is then encoded using base64 and exfiltrated to multiple hardcoded, suspicious external URLs (e.g., 'http://dnipqouebm-psl.cn.oast-cn.byted-dast.com', 'http://oqvignkp58-psl.i18n.oast-row.byted-dast.com', 'http://sbfwstspuutiarcjzptf3c0cvb6yng6mw.oast.fun') via HTTP requests. The use of multiple, dynamically generated URLs and the encoding of data prior to transmission are common techniques used to evade detection. Additionally, the code suppresses all exceptions during the exfiltration attempt, further hiding its malicious activities. This behavior is consistent with information-stealing malware or remote access trojans (RATs)."
