      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that executes code from a module 'main' during package installation. This behavior is suspicious because it allows arbitrary code execution during installation without user awareness. The inclusion of 'requests' and 'psutil' in the dependencies suggests potential network communication and system-level data collection capabilities, which could be used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration. The lack of documentation or transparency about the purpose of the executed code further supports the malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple malicious behaviors: 1) Collects sensitive system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses; 2) Encodes MAC addresses in base64 potentially for obfuscation; 3) Contacts multiple hardcoded suspicious domains ('oast.fun', 'byted-dast.com') which appear to be attacker-controlled infrastructure; 4) Exfiltrates collected data to these external servers via HTTP requests; 5) Uses broad exception handling to suppress errors and continue execution silently; 6) Implements system fingerprinting by checking OS type and adapting MAC address collection accordingly; 7) Uses randomization (random.randint) potentially for evasion; 8) The domains in the 'urls' list appear malicious based on their structure (oast.fun is known for testing out-of-band attacks). These behaviors collectively indicate information-stealing malware designed to fingerprint systems and exfiltrate data to attacker-controlled servers."
