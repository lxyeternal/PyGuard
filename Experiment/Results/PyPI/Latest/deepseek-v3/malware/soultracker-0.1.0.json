      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several characteristics of malicious behavior, including creating a backdoor script that connects to a remote server to fetch and execute arbitrary commands, hiding the backdoor script file, and ensuring it runs on system startup. Specifically, it writes a script to a hidden location, uses system commands to run the script in the background, and employs persistence mechanisms (e.g., adding to startup folder or .bashrc file) to remain active after reboots. The backdoor script itself continuously polls a remote server for commands to execute, posing a significant security risk as it allows remote control of the infected system without user consent."
