      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple characteristics indicative of malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command that downloads an executable file from a remote URL ('https://filetransfer.io/data-package/MG85ggQt/download') and saves it to the user's LOCALAPPDATA directory under the name 'Driver.exe'. After downloading, the code attempts to execute the downloaded file using ctypes.windll.kernel32.WinExec. This behavior is consistent with malware that downloads and executes malicious payloads during package installation. The use of setuptools installation hooks to perform these actions without user consent is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. Additionally, the downloaded file's destination and execution are hidden from the user, and the code includes generic exception handling to suppress errors, further indicating malicious intent."
