It then executes this downloaded file using ctypes.windll.kernel32.WinExec. This behavior is characteristic of malware, as it involves downloading and executing arbitrary code from an external source during package installation, which can lead to unauthorized code execution on the victim's system. The use of urllib.request to download the file and the immediate execution without user consent or notification further confirm its malicious intent."
