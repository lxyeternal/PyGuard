      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged subprocess.check_output calls execute static, well-known system utilities ('aflow' and 'units') with fixed arguments to check for their presence in the PATH. There is no evidence of dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, obfuscation, or interaction with sensitive files or network resources. The subprocess calls are wrapped in try/except blocks with user-facing warnings and print statements, indicating transparent error handling. The code does not process or transmit the output of these commands, nor does it perform any suspicious actions before, during, or after their execution. This pattern is typical of benign setup or environment-check scripts, especially in scientific or open-source projects. The use of setuptools.setup() at the end is standard for Python package setup scripts. Therefore, the tool's detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the presence of subprocess calls during installation, which, while a potential supply chain risk in general, is not inherently malicious in this context.",
