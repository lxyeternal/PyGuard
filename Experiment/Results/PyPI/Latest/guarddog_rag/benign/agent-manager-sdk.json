      "false_positive_reason": "The code is a CLI tool for managing 'agents' and 'workflows' in a local and central registry, with user-facing commands for initialization, synchronization, publishing, and pulling of agent data. The flagged 'shady-links' detections are due to the use of a hardcoded ngrok URL (https://funky-open-wahoo.ngrok-free.app/miniapps/agents) as the central server endpoint. However, all network operations are clearly tied to explicit user commands (e.g., 'publish', 'agents', 'pull'), and the data sent/received is agent/workflow metadata, not sensitive system or user information. There is no evidence of dynamic code execution, credential theft, environment exfiltration, persistence mechanisms, or obfuscation. The code includes user prompts, error handling, and clear business logic. The use of requests to a non-corporate domain is a potential risk, but in this context, it is transparent and user-driven. Therefore, this is a false positive.",

The code does not collect, encode, or exfiltrate system/user information, nor does it perform dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or any other behavior associated with malware. The endpoint is a legitimate API for the Together AI service, and the code is structured as a model provider integration, not as a standalone executable or installer. There is no evidence of credential theft, data exfiltration, or persistence mechanisms. The use of a hardcoded API endpoint alone, especially for a known service, is not sufficient to classify the code as malicious.",
