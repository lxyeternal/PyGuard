There is clear user interaction, consent, and notification for each clipboard operation. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, network communication, dynamic code execution, or any other suspicious or malicious behavior. Clipboard access in this context is a standard feature for password managers, allowing users to conveniently paste passwords into login forms. The code is well-structured, with logging, error handling, and user prompts, and does not match any of the high-risk or critical-risk patterns associated with malware. Therefore, the security tool's detection is a false positive.",
