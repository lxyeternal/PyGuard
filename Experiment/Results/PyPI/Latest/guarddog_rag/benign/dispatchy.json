      "false_positive_reason": "The code implements classes for sending messages via Discord and Telegram webhooks. The flagged lines are related to (1) validating that a Discord webhook URL starts with the official Discord API endpoint, and (2) constructing the standard Telegram API endpoint for sending messages. These are standard, well-documented API endpoints for legitimate bot/webhook integrations. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, credential theft, or any other malicious behavior. The code does not collect or transmit sensitive system/user information, nor does it perform any obfuscation, privilege escalation, or persistence techniques. The use of requests to send data is expected for webhook functionality, and all network destinations are official, well-known service endpoints. The code is well-structured, documented, and contains appropriate error handling. Therefore, the tool's detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the presence of webhook and API URLs, which are common in benign automation and bot code.",
