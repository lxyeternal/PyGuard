      "false_positive_reason": "The code flagged by the tool (the use of the hardcoded URL 'https://api.claudeshop.top/v1/chat/completions') is not, by itself, a definitive indicator of malicious behavior. The code implements a client for interacting with two AI chat completion APIs (one at claudeshop.top, one at aliyun), using API keys read from local files or environment variables. The code does not collect or exfiltrate sensitive system/user information, nor does it execute or download arbitrary code, nor does it perform any obfuscation, privilege escalation, or persistence techniques. The only data sent to the external API is user-supplied prompts for AI completion, which is expected for this type of application. The use of a non-official or non-corporate domain (claudeshop.top) is unusual and may warrant further scrutiny of the service itself, but the code's behavior is consistent with a benign API client. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, credential theft, or other malicious activity. The detection is a false positive due to the presence of a non-standard API endpoint, not due to any actual malicious logic in the code.",
