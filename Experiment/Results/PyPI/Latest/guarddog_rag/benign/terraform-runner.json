There is no evidence of exfiltration of sensitive system or user information, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious or hardcoded domains. The use of subprocess is limited to running Terraform commands in a specified working directory, which is standard for automation scripts. The Telegram API usage is transparent, well-documented, and does not involve sending sensitive data without user consent. This pattern is common in CI/CD automation and infrastructure management tools for notification purposes. The flagged line is a standard API endpoint for Telegram bots, not a shady or suspicious link.",
