This is a common, benign feature in many developer tools to improve usability. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, network communication, dynamic code execution, or access to sensitive system/user information. The clipboard operation is gated behind a user-controlled flag (--clipboard/--no-clipboard), and the data copied is the same as what is printed to the console and optionally saved to a file. The code is transparent, well-structured, and lacks any indicators of malicious intent or behavior as described in the provided knowledge points.",
