The flagged line (base_url=\"https://discord.com/api/v10\") is a standard, official Discord API endpoint, not a suspicious or non-corporate domain. The code does not collect or exfiltrate system/user information, does not perform dynamic code execution, does not use obfuscation, and does not interact with sensitive files or directories. All network communication is directed at Discord's official API for legitimate bot/selfbot functionality (sending messages, editing, deleting, etc.). There is clear logging, error handling, and no evidence of credential theft, persistence, or data exfiltration. The use of a hardcoded API URL is expected and benign in this context. The only potential ToS violation is the use of a selfbot, but this is not a security/malware concern. Therefore, the tool's detection is a false positive.",
