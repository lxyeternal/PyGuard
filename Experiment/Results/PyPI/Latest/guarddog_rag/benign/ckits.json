      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged code is a standard Python setuptools setup script. While it does define a CustomInstallCommand class, the run() method only calls the default install.run(self) and does not execute any additional or suspicious code. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, network communication, obfuscation, or any of the high-risk behaviors associated with malicious supply chain attacks. The use of variables for project metadata and requirements is typical for Python packaging. The only file read is 'requirements.txt', which is standard for specifying dependencies. No sensitive data is accessed, no shell commands are executed, and no external communication occurs. The detection appears to be a false positive, likely triggered by the presence of a custom install command, which is a benign and common pattern in Python packaging.",
