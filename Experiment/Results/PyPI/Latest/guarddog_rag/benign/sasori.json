All clipboard access is accompanied by user-facing messages (via typer.secho), clear error handling, and is part of a CLI tool for managing prompts and files. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, network communication, dynamic code execution, or any attempt to steal or transmit clipboard contents elsewhere. The clipboard access is transparent, documented, and limited to legitimate, user-initiated actions. This pattern is common in benign CLI utilities and does not match any of the high-risk or critical-risk patterns associated with malware.",
