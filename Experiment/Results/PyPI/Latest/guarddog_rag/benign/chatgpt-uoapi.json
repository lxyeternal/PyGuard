This means arbitrary code in update_config() will be executed automatically on the installer's system during package installation, without user interaction or consent. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python, as it enables arbitrary code execution at install time, which is strongly associated with malware and is rarely justified in benign packages. The code does not provide any documentation or user-facing explanation for this behavior, and the actual content of update_config() is not shown, so it could perform any action, including data exfiltration, persistence, or further payload delivery. The use of this pattern in setup scripts is a critical risk and is consistently associated with malicious activity in the Python ecosystem.",
