It uses custom setuptools commands (install, develop, egg_info) to copy prompt files from a project-level 'prompts' directory into the package directory at build/install time. This is a common pattern for including non-code assets in a Python package. There is no evidence of dynamic code execution, network communication, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or obfuscation. All file operations are limited to the package's own directories and are well-documented. The flagged 'cmd-overwrite' pattern is a standard use of setuptools' cmdclass to customize installation behavior, which is widely used in benign open-source projects. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are present.",
