This is a common and benign pattern in Python packages that require native code compilation (e.g., C/C++ extensions) before installation. The command is static, does not execute arbitrary or user-supplied code, does not download or run remote payloads, and does not exfiltrate data or interact with sensitive system resources. There is no evidence of obfuscation, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or other malicious behaviors. The use of subprocess here is transparent, well-documented, and limited to a standard build process, which is a typical and legitimate use case in open-source Python projects.",
