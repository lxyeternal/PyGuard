The CustomInstallCommand class does not execute any additional code beyond calling the default install.run(self) method. There are no suspicious imports, no dynamic code execution (e.g., exec, eval, subprocess), no network operations, no data exfiltration, and no obfuscation. The use of variables for metadata (e.g., __author__, __version__) is typical for Python packages. The only file read is 'requirements.txt' to populate install_requires, which is a common and benign pattern. The custom install command is present but does not perform any actions beyond the default installation. Therefore, the tool's detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the presence of a custom install command, which is not inherently malicious without additional suspicious behavior.",
