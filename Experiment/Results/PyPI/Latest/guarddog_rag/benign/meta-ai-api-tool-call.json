      "false_positive_reason": "The code in question is a client for interacting with Meta AI (Facebook's AI platform) and, optionally, Facebook authentication. The flagged line (use of https://api.ipify.org/?format=json) is used to check the external IP address when setting up a proxy, which is a common and benign practice in networked applications to verify proxy functionality. The code does not collect or exfiltrate sensitive system/user data, does not execute arbitrary code, does not use obfuscation, and does not interact with suspicious or non-corporate domains. All network requests are directed to official Facebook/Meta endpoints or to api.ipify.org (a well-known public IP-checking service). There is no evidence of credential theft, persistence, privilege escalation, or dynamic code execution. The code is well-structured, documented, and its network activity is transparent and justified by its purpose. The security tool likely flagged the use of api.ipify.org as a 'shady-link', but in this context, it is a standard, non-malicious usage.",
