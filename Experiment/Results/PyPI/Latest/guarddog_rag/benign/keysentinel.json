The use of subprocess.Popen to spawn a detached process is for the purpose of delayed clipboard clearing, not for executing arbitrary or remote code. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, network communication, credential theft, persistence mechanisms, or obfuscation. Clipboard access is documented and justified by the function's purpose. All subprocess commands are static, do not involve user/system data exfiltration, and are limited to clipboard manipulation. The code does not match any of the high-risk or critical-risk malicious patterns described, and its structure and intent are consistent with benign, privacy-focused utilities.",
