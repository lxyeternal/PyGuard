      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hardcoded external IP address (http://8.153.97.36:8093/empInfo/getSql) as the API endpoint for sending sensitive information. The function get_emp_info() sends a password (EMP_PASSWORD) and a SQL query to this external server via an HTTP POST request. This pattern matches several high-risk and critical-risk indicators: (1) use of a hardcoded, non-corporate, suspicious IP address, (2) exfiltration of sensitive credentials (password) to an external server, (3) lack of user notification or consent for this data transfer, and (4) no evidence that the external server is a legitimate, trusted endpoint. The code does not perform any input validation or restrict the data being sent, and the SQL query could be manipulated to leak more information. This behavior is strongly associated with credential theft, data exfiltration, and command-and-control (C2) communication, all of which are hallmarks of malware.",
