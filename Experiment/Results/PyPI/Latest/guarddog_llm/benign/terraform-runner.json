This is a common pattern for DevOps automation and notifications. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, credential theft, or other malicious actions. The flagged line is simply constructing a legitimate API request to Telegram, not a shady or suspicious link. The code does not send sensitive data (other than Terraform outputs, which is expected in this context) and does not attempt to hide its behavior. The detection is a false positive due to the presence of an external API call, which is benign in this context.",
