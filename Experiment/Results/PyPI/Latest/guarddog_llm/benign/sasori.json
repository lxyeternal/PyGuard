There is no evidence of exfiltration, unauthorized access, or hidden behavior. Clipboard access is a legitimate feature in many CLI tools for user convenience. The flagged lines are not inherently malicious and are used transparently. The detection is a false positive due to the presence of clipboard access, which is not malicious in this context.",
