      "false_positive_reason": "The code implements classes for sending messages via Discord and Telegram webhooks. The flagged lines are related to validating Discord webhook URLs and constructing the Telegram API endpoint, both of which are standard and necessary for legitimate webhook functionality. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, credential theft, or other malicious actions. The code does not collect or transmit user data except as explicitly configured by the user for the purpose of sending messages to Discord or Telegram. The use of these URLs is expected in any code that interacts with these services. The security tool likely flagged these lines due to the presence of webhook and API URLs, which are sometimes used in malicious code, but in this context, their use is benign and appropriate.",
