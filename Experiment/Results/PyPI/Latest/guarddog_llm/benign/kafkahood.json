If the download fails, it writes a default configuration. While downloading remote resources during installation is not best practice and can be risky, this code does not execute any downloaded code, nor does it exfiltrate data or perform any clearly malicious actions. The behavior is more indicative of a package that wants to bootstrap its configuration from a central source. The flagged line is simply the setup() call, which is standard in Python packaging. The detection is likely a false positive due to the presence of remote resource fetching in the install process.",
