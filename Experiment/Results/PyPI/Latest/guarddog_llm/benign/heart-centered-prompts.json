The only non-standard behavior is the use of custom setuptools commands (CustomInstall, CustomDevelop, CustomEggInfo) to copy prompt files from a project-level 'prompts' directory into the package directory at build/install time. This is a common pattern for including non-code assets in a package and does not execute arbitrary code, download remote resources, or perform any suspicious actions. The flagged 'cmd-overwrite' is likely a heuristic that triggers on any use of the 'cmdclass' argument in setup(), but in this context, it is used for legitimate package data management. No evidence of malicious behavior is present.",
