      "false_positive_reason": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command (PostInstallCommand) that, after installation, imports and calls update_config() from models.utils. This pattern is sometimes flagged as suspicious because post-install hooks can be abused to execute arbitrary code. However, in this context, the code only calls update_config(), which is not shown here. There is no evidence in this snippet of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The detection is likely a false positive due to the use of a post-install hook, which is a common vector for abuse but not inherently malicious.",
