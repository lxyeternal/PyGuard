However, the code's use of this URL is consistent with its stated purpose: to publish, fetch, and synchronize agent and workflow data with a central server as part of an agent package manager CLI. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, credential theft, or other covert/malicious activity. All network interactions are explicit, user-initiated, and related to the application's functionality. The use of a public ngrok endpoint may be flagged as 'shady' by automated tools, but in this context, it is not inherently malicious.",
