The syscall function locates the syscall ID for a given ntdll.dll function, builds a shellcode stub for it, marks the memory as executable, and returns a callable function pointer. This technique is commonly used in malware to evade user-mode hooks and security products, as it allows direct invocation of system calls. The use of VirtualProtect to mark memory as executable and the construction of raw shellcode are strong indicators of malicious intent or at least dual-use capability for offensive security purposes.",
