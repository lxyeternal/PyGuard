The password is sent in the 'password' field of the request body. This behavior is highly suspicious and matches common credential exfiltration techniques, especially since the server IP is hardcoded and not a known trusted endpoint. There is no legitimate reason for a tool to send user-supplied passwords to an external, non-corporate server in this manner.",
