It copies a given text to the clipboard and then, after a timeout, overwrites the clipboard with random data and clears it. This is a common security practice to prevent sensitive data from lingering in the clipboard. The use of subprocess.Popen to spawn a detached process for clipboard clearing and the use of pyperclip to access the clipboard are both legitimate in this context. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, unauthorized access, or other malicious intent. The security tool likely flagged this due to the use of subprocess and clipboard access, which are common in both benign and malicious code, but in this case, the behavior is justified and not malicious.",
