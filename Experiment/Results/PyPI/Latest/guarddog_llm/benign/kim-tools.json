If these executables are not found, it warns the user and prints a message. This is a common pattern for checking dependencies in Python packages. There is no evidence of code execution with user-supplied input, downloading or running arbitrary code, or any other malicious behavior. The security tool likely flagged this due to the use of subprocess, but in this context, it is benign.",
