The flagged line (use of 'https://api.claudeshop.top/v1/chat/completions') is simply the endpoint for a third-party API service, similar to how one might use OpenAI or other cloud AI APIs. The code reads API keys from local files, constructs prompts, and sends them to the specified API endpoints to get responses. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, credential theft, remote code execution, or any other malicious activity. The only network activity is to the declared API endpoints for their intended purpose. The detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the use of a non-standard API endpoint, but this alone does not constitute malicious behavior.",
