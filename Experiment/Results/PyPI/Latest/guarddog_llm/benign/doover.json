The use of ngrok domains (such as 1.tcp.au.ngrok.io) is common in development and remote access tools for tunneling local services to the internet. In this context, the code is part of a CLI tool for managing 'doover' agents, and the ngrok domain is used as a default endpoint for TCP tunnels. There is no evidence that this is used for exfiltration or C2 communication; it is a user-facing feature for remote access.\n\n2. The use of requests.get(\"https://api.ipify.org\").text is a standard way to obtain the public IP address of the machine. This is used in the context of restricting tunnel access to the user's current IP address, which is a legitimate security feature.\n\nThere is no evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, credential theft, or other malicious behaviors. All network operations are either user-initiated or part of the expected functionality of a remote management CLI. The flagged lines are common in legitimate software that uses ngrok for tunneling and needs to know the public IP for access control.\n\nTherefore, the tool's detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the presence of ngrok domains and public IP lookups, which are not inherently malicious.",
