The flagged line (base_url=\"https://discord.com/api/v10\") is simply the official Discord API endpoint, which is required for any Discord bot or selfbot to function. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, credential theft, or other malicious activity. The code does not send data to any non-Discord endpoints, nor does it perform suspicious actions outside the expected Discord API usage. The detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the presence of a Discord API URL, which is not inherently malicious.",
